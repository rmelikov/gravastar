# Abstract

We present **Gravastar**, a microphysics-agnostic, *teleomorphic* (ends-first) validation calculus that operationalizes the **Principle of Superposition (PoS)**: *“Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”* Here, *acceptable to all* means **universally admissible under open-join audit**: **any observer admissible under the declared observer-equivalence group $G$** (e.g., paraphrase, ordering, units/encodings, tokenization, locale) and who follows the public method reproduces the decision within declared budgets; any compliant counterexample defeats the claim.

The calculus is formalized by the **Timeline Selection Theorem (TST)** and a ternary decision gate $\delta\in\{-1,0,+1\}$: $\delta=+1$ admits and actualizes a candidate timeline, $\delta=0$ preserves superposition, and $\delta=-1$ vetoes.

Decisions draw on an **acceptability field** $\Phi(x,t)$ with preregistered bands $\Phi_{\text{neutral}}$ (indifference) and $\Phi_{\min}$ (strict pass), together with a **moral geometry** $y=\mathrm{arctanh}(x)$. We map $\Phi$ to orientation by $x = 2(\Phi/\Phi_{\max}) - 1$, **where $\Phi_{\max}$** is the preregistered maximum acceptability in the pinned **III.json manifest**; thus $x\!\to\!-1^{+}$ marks moral egoism, $x=0$ neutrality, and $x\!\to\!1^{-}$ moral perfection. The gradient $dy/dx = 1/(1-x^2)$ yields an explicit **repair vector** whenever $\delta\in\{-1,0\}$. All comparisons obey **round-before-compare** at precisions fixed in **III.json** (budgets, rounding, tie policy).

Correctness is enforced by fail-closed **floors** that **dominate $\Phi$**: a **G-floor** (gauge invariance under admissible redescriptions; observer-equivalence group G), the **PoS Screen** (neutrality operations only), **WITNESS** (asynchronous $W(n)$ with separability bounds $B(n)$ ), **CAUSALITY/ISO** (near-isotropy $A^\star$ and fitted front-speed cap $\hat c \le 1$), **CAPTION→RECEIPT** byte-equality binding, and **DETERMINISM**. A default invariant set (**DII-4**) is preregistered in **III.json**: $R(u)$ (universality ratio), $A^\star$, $\hat c$, and $W(n)$ vs $B(n)$. Methods are standardized via **ScanProtocol v1** (bidirectional scans, dark-window readout, $\ge 3\cdot\tau_{\text{reset}}$ waits, three-grid alias refuter; with bright/dark basis disclosure when interference or phase matters).

An optional **engineered $\Phi$** layer (Discrete Nonlinear Transport) is quarantined—useful for “soliton-like” dynamics—yet cannot relax floors and must publish a causality cap $\hat c$. **Portability is demonstrated on the Adamas-1D physical testbed** (e.g., carbon-nanotube (CNT) strain/spectroscopy runs) with $\delta$-windows, byte-equality receipts, and end-to-end **REPLAY-RFD**; see also **SSH-like topological transitions under CNT strain** for context. In an agentless limit (CHSH [1]; see §9) of the witness program (e.g., **Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt, CHSH [1]**), the framework recovers standard quantum predictions; in all cases, admissibility is decided by $\delta$, not narrative. Panels/coverage may be reported as evidence, but **never define “all.”** The result is a gauge-invariant, time-stable, auditable standard for **admissible outcomes** that makes the PoS actionable and falsifiable.

**Operational translation.** A claim has standing **if and only if** its warrant is **publicly reproducible** by any competent inquirer following the shared method; it is **invariant under admissible redescriptions** and **stable across time**; and **any compliant counterexample defeats it**. In this paper, “receipt-true” means **$\delta = +1$** with **floors dominating $\Phi$**, a **G-floor pass**, and **TTDA time spine** (UTC-LCRO badge, streaming/batch parity, explain\_url), with **caption→receipt binding** and **REPLAY-RFD** to first divergence. The validation state is **ternary-encoded as** $\delta\in\{-1,0,+1\}$; “count” means **admitted to the $\delta$ decision calculus** (subject to the PoS Screen and supersession).

## 1.1 Motivation and scope

Scientific claims, safety decisions, and model deployments are too often adjudicated by **narrative** rather than by a uniform, audit-ready calculus. Two failure modes recur:

1. **Context drift** — small changes in wording, encodings, locale, or time base flip a result.
2. **Temporal fragility** — streaming vs. batch, clock skew, or replay order alters the decision.

**Gravastar** responds with a **microphysics-agnostic, ends-first (teleomorphic)** validation standard that decides *admissible outcomes* the same way everywhere, under open audit.

**Principle.** Gravastar operationalizes the **Principle of Superposition (PoS)** — “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.” Here, *acceptable to all* means **universally admissible under open-join audit**: any observer admissible under the declared observer-equivalence group $G$ who follows the public method reproduces the decision within preregistered budgets; any compliant counterexample defeats the claim. The calculus is value-neutral about content; it encodes **how** claims must be warranted to **count**.

**Framework (at a glance).**

* **Ternary gate and TST.** A **Timeline Selection Theorem (TST)** governs a ternary decision gate $\delta \in {-1,0,+1}$: $\delta=+1$ admits and actualizes a candidate timeline; $\delta=0$ preserves superposition; $\delta=-1$ vetoes.
* **Acceptability field and moral geometry.** Decisions use an **acceptability field** $\Phi(x,t)$ with preregistered bands $\Phi_{\mathrm{neutral}}$ (indifference) and $\Phi_{\min}$ (strict pass). Orientation is set by
  $x = 2(\Phi/\Phi_{\max}) - 1,$
  with $\Phi_{\max}$ preregistered, and the moral state $y=\mathrm{arctanh}(x)$ exposes a **repair vector** via $dy/dx = 1/(1-x^{2})$ whenever $\delta \in {-1,0}$.
* **Pinned manifest and comparisons.** A pinned `III.json` declares budgets, thresholds, rounding, and tie policy; all comparisons obey **round-before-compare** at the declared precisions.
* **Floors dominate $\Phi$.** Fail-closed floors are prerequisites: **G-floor** (gauge invariance under admissible re-descriptions), **PoS Screen** (neutrality-only ops), **WITNESS** (asynchronous $W(n)$ vs. separability bounds B(n)), **CAUSALITY/ISO** (near-isotropy $A^\star$ and front-speed cap $\hat{c} \le 1$), **CAPTION $\to$ RECEIPT** (byte-equality), and **DETERMINISM** (RNG freeze, platform parity). If a floor fails, $\delta$ cannot pass on the basis of $\Phi$.
* **Temporal governance and receipts.** **TTDA** supplies the time spine: a UTC-anchored **Clock Disclosure Badge**, a **Right-to-Temporal-Resolution** budget, and an explicitly preregistered **streaming/batch parity** bound. Evidence is packaged as **Receipt v2** (code/data/SBOM hashes, thresholds, energy) and audited by **REPLAY-RFD** (Replay-to-First-Divergence).

**Scope — what this paper does and does not claim.**
Gravastar is a **validation calculus**, not a dynamics proposal. It specifies the warrant and audit conditions under which claims **count**; it remains agnostic to content so long as the method is public, observers are admissible under $G$, and compliant counterexamples defeat the claim.

**Intended users and artifacts.**
Experimentalists, ML/AI deployment teams, standards bodies, and auditors seeking a gauge-invariant, time-stable, auditable standard for **admissible outcomes** under open-join audit.

## 1.2 The Principle of Superposition (PoS): “acceptable to all”

Only **neutrality-preserving** operations are permitted while $\delta=0$; **repairs must not tilt the gate**.

**Law (plain language).** *Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.*
“Acceptable to all” means **universally admissible under open-join audit**: any observer admissible under the declared observer-equivalence group $G$ who follows the public method reproduces the decision within preregistered budgets; **one compliant counterexample defeats** the claim.

**Who is “all”?** “All” is **not** a survey panel, a coverage metric, a popularity vote, or any other selection-dependent notion. “All” means **every observer admissible under $G$**—including admissible re-descriptions (tokenization, units/encodings, paraphrase/order, locale)—who follows the method and budgets (time governance, scan protocol) and can reproduce or defeat the decision.

**Operational form (acceptability).**
Let $\tau$ be a candidate timeline and $M$ the declared method (models, data, thresholds, budgets, scan protocol). For any admissible observer $o$:
$\delta_o(\tau; M) \in {-1,0,+1}$.

PoS is satisfied for $\tau$ iff:

* **(i) Floors)** $\forall o$: all floors pass and **dominate** $\Phi$.
* **(ii) Reproducibility)** $\forall o$: $\delta_o(\tau;M)=+1$ within preregistered budgets.
* **(iii) Invariance)** $\forall g\in G,\ \forall o$: $\delta_o(g\cdot \tau;, g\cdot M)=\delta_o(\tau;M)$.
* **(iv) Time stability)** streaming/batch parity and other TTDA time constraints hold as preregistered.
* **(v) Defeat)** if a compliant counterexample exists, then $\delta\neq+1$ (claim loses standing).

**Acceptability field and moral geometry.**
Decisions use an **acceptability field** $\Phi(x,t)$ with preregistered bands $\Phi_{\mathrm{neutral}}$ (indifference) and $\Phi_{\min}$ (strict pass). Orientation is set by
$x = 2(\Phi/\Phi_{\max}) - 1,\quad y=\mathrm{arctanh}(x),\quad \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{1-x^{2}},$
with $\Phi_{\max}$ preregistered in `III.json`. When $\delta\in{-1,0}$, the **repair vector** is read off from $dy/dx$ (how to change inputs to reach $\Phi_{\min}$ under the floors).

**Floors (fail-closed; dominate $\Phi$).**
**G-floor** (gauge invariance under admissible re-descriptions), **PoS Screen** (neutrality-only ops), **WITNESS** (asynchronous $W(n)$ vs. separability bounds B(n)), **CAUSALITY/ISO** (near-isotropy $A^\star$ and front-speed cap $\hat{c}\le 1$), **CAPTION $\to$ RECEIPT** (byte-equality), **DETERMINISM** (RNG freeze, platform parity). **If any floor fails, $\delta$ cannot pass on the basis of $\Phi$.**

**Temporal governance (TTDA) and receipts.**
TTDA provides the **time spine**: UTC-anchored **Clock Disclosure Badge**, **Right-to-Temporal-Resolution** budget, and a preregistered **streaming/batch parity** bound. Evidence is packaged as **Receipt v2** (hashes, thresholds, energy) and audited by **REPLAY-RFD** (Replay-to-First-Divergence).

**Decision rule (sketch).**

1. **Verify floors.** If any floor fails → $\delta=-1$ (report failure + repair vector).
2. **Compute effective field.** Apply budgets (TTDA, etc.), then compare to $\Phi_{\min}$ and $\Phi_{\mathrm{neutral}}$ using **round-before-compare** at precisions declared in `III.json`.
3. **Gate.** If $\Phi \ge \Phi_{\min}$ and floors pass → $\delta=+1$; if $\Phi \in \Phi_{\mathrm{neutral}}$ → $\delta=0$; else $\delta=-1$.
4. **Audit.** Publish **Receipt v2** and a **REPLAY-RFD** trace; run $G$-tests and TTDA parity checks; invite open-join reproduction.
5. **Supersession.** Any **compliant counterexample** (floor violation or first divergence) **defeats** the standing and triggers supersession.

**What PoS guarantees (and what it doesn’t).**
PoS guarantees a **gauge-invariant, time-stable, open-audit** standard for a claim to **count** under the universal quantifier “all.” It does **not** guarantee truth beyond the declared method/budgets; it guarantees that **standing** is earned only by meeting floors, invariance, time stability, and defeat-by-counterexample.

## 1.3 Contributions and summary of results

**Problem.** Across science, engineering, and AI deployment, admissibility is too often decided by narrative and selection effects. Small re-descriptions (paraphrase, units/encodings, locale, tokenization, ordering) or timebase changes (streaming vs. batch, clock skew, replay order) can flip outcomes. We require a gauge-invariant, time-stable, open-audit calculus that makes *“acceptable to all”* operational, falsifiable, and reproducible.

**Contributions.**

* **Law → calculus.** We formalize the Principle of Superposition (PoS)—“Do only that, which would be acceptable to all”—into a validation calculus that is **universally admissible under open-join audit**: any observer admissible under the declared observer-equivalence group $G$ who follows the public method reproduces the decision within preregistered budgets; any compliant counterexample defeats a claim.
* **Timeline Selection Theorem (TST) & ternary gate.** We define a ternary decision gate $\delta \in {-1,0,+1}$ governed by TST: $\delta=+1$ **admits** and actualizes a candidate timeline; $\delta=0$ **preserves superposition**; $\delta=-1$ **vetoes**. Defeat by compliant counterexample triggers **supersession**.
* **Acceptability field and moral geometry with repairs.** We introduce an **acceptability field** $\Phi(x,t)$ with preregistered bands $\Phi_{\mathrm{neutral}}$ (indifference) and $\Phi_{\min}$ (strict pass), orientation
  $x = 2(\Phi/\Phi_{\max}) - 1,\quad y=\mathrm{arctanh}(x),\quad \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{1}{1-x^{2}},$
  and an explicit **repair vector** for $\delta \in {-1,0}$ that prescribes minimal adjustments toward admissibility **without breaking floors**.
* **Floors that dominate $\Phi$.** We specify **fail-closed invariants** that must pass before $\Phi$ can decide: **G-floor** (gauge invariance under admissible re-descriptions), **PoS Screen** (neutrality-only ops), **WITNESS** (asynchronous $W(n)$ vs. separability bounds B(n)), **CAUSALITY/ISO** (near-isotropy $A^\star$ and front-speed cap $\hat{c} \le 1$), **CAPTION $\to$ RECEIPT** (byte-equality), and **DETERMINISM** (RNG freeze, platform parity). **Floors $\gg \Phi$:** no amount of score mass can rescue a floor failure.
* **Temporal governance (TTDA).** We define a UTC-anchored **Clock Disclosure Badge**, a **Right-to-Temporal-Resolution** budget, and preregistered **streaming/batch parity** constraints; temporal budgets are integrated directly into the decision calculus with **round-before-compare**, pinned in the **III.json** manifest.
* **Receipts and auditability.** We provide **Receipt v2** (code/data/SBOM hashes, thresholds, energy, explain_url) and **REPLAY-RFD** (Replay-to-First-Divergence) for byte-equality binding and auditor-grade reproducibility (first divergence is the stopping rule).
* **Methods standardization.** We publish **ScanProtocol v1** (bidirectional scans, dark-window readout, waits of $\ge 3\cdot\tau_{\mathrm{reset}}$, three-grid alias refuter; basis disclosure when interference or phase matters) and a default invariant set **DII-4** $\bigl(R(u), A^\star, \hat{c}, W(n)!:!B(n)\bigr)$.
* **Witness program and agentless limit.** We define CHSH-style witnesses and an **agentless** limit that recovers standard quantum predictions and cleanly explains why **panels/coverage are evidence but never define “all.”**
* **Quarantined dynamics (optional).** We include an **engineered $\Phi$** layer (discrete nonlinear transport) that is quarantined from the decision kernel, cannot relax floors, and must publish a measured causality cap $\hat{c}$.
* **Portability demonstration (Adamas-1D).** We provide a physical testbed (e.g., CNT strain/spectroscopy runs with $\delta$-windows, byte-equality receipts, and end-to-end REPLAY-RFD) showing that the calculus is microphysics-agnostic; Adamas-1D serves as a concrete instantiation.
* **Governance and supersession.** We define an **open-join audit** and **supersession** regime whereby a compliant counterexample or first divergence removes standing and replaces prior decisions with a receipt-backed update.

**Summary of results.**
The paper delivers: (i) a **provable decision kernel** (TST + ternary gate) with defeat/supersession; (ii) a **moral-geometry repair calculus** $y=\mathrm{arctanh}(x)$ with a usable gradient $dy/dx=1/(1-x^{2})$; (iii) a **floor system that dominates $\Phi$** (G-floor, PoS Screen, WITNESS, CAUSALITY/ISO, CAPTION $\to$ RECEIPT, DETERMINISM); (iv) a **pinned manifest** with **round-before-compare**; (v) a **TTDA time spine** (Clock Badge, RTR budget, streaming/batch parity); (vi) **Receipt v2 + REPLAY-RFD**; (vii) **ScanProtocol v1** and **DII-4**; (viii) portability to **Adamas-1D** and recovery of **CHSH** predictions in the agentless witness program. Together these components yield a gauge-invariant, time-stable, auditable standard for **admissible outcomes** under the universal law *“acceptable to all.”*

### Rounding conventions: **round-before-compare (RBC)**

All admissibility comparisons use a **deterministic** procedure with **declared precision and tie policy**. Printed decimals in receipts are part of the evidence and must match the declared precision.

**R0 — Canonicalize, then operate.**
Normalize locale/encoding (decimal point `.`, minus `-`, no thousands separators) and **cast units** to the canonical unit in `III.json` before any rounding or comparison.

**R1 — Budgeting, then rounding.**
For any scalar metric $m$ (e.g., $\Phi$, $A^\star$, $\hat{c}$, $R(u)$, $W(n)$ ):

1. cast to the canonical unit; 2) apply budgeting (if declared) to form an effective value; 3) round to precision $p(m)$ with tie policy $\text{tie}(m)$. Notation: $r(v; p,\text{tie})$, where $r$ denotes the rounding function.

**R2 — Round, then compare.**
Compare **rounded** values only. If a threshold/band endpoint is $\theta$, compute

$$
m'=\mathrm{round}_{p_{\mathrm{cmp}},\ \mathrm{tie}_{\mathrm{cmp}}}(m),\quad
\theta'=\mathrm{round}_{p_{\mathrm{cmp}},\ \mathrm{tie}_{\mathrm{cmp}}}(\theta),
$$

then evaluate the declared relation on $(m',\theta')$.

* Non-strict ($\ge,\le$): pass iff $m'\ge \theta'$ (resp. $m'\le \theta'$).
* Strict ($>,<$): pass iff $m' > \theta'$ (resp. $m' < \theta'$). Equality after rounding does **not** pass a strict bound.

**R3 — Bands & windows.**
For band $B=[\theta_L,\theta_U]$ (closed recommended), round both endpoints and $m$ with the same comparison spec; pass iff $\theta_L' \le m' \le \theta_U'$. For half-open bands, declare closure in `III.json`.

**R4 — Arrays & aggregates.**
For vectors/tuples, apply **R1–R3** component-wise **before** any aggregate rule. If the threshold is on an aggregate (e.g., $|\mathbf v|_2 \ge \theta$), compute the aggregate from **rounded** components, then apply **R2**.

**R5 — Printed decimals = audit surface.**
Receipts must print exactly the declared decimals for each audited value; the tie policy must be stated. Auditors re-execute RBC during **REPLAY-RFD**.

**R6 — Deterministic tie policy.**
Tie policy is fixed per metric in `III.json` (e.g., half-even, half-up, toward-zero, floor/ceil). Don’t mix policies for the **same** metric across sections.

**R7 — Binary floating-point guard.**
If binary FP is used at run time, the receipt pins: (i) library and flags, (ii) decimal presentation precision, (iii) an ulp tolerance for internal checks. External admissibility still follows RBC with the manifest’s decimal precision.

**R8 — Time spine & parity checks.**
TTDA parity/temporal checks compare **rounded** statistics at the declared precision unless the manifest specifies exact match for discrete states (e.g., $\delta$). For real-valued deltas (latency, energy, AUC), apply **R1–R3** before evaluating the TTDA bound (budget $\Pi$).

**R9 — Strings & bytes (non-numeric).**
RBC **never** applies to **CAPTION $\to$ RECEIPT**: captions bind to receipts by **byte-equality**. Any display transformation is documented and excluded from the bound bytes.

#### Canonical compare (reference pseudocode)

```text
function CMP(m, theta, spec):
    # spec: {unit, precision p, tie_policy, budgeting}
    v = cast_unit(m, spec.unit)
    t = cast_unit(theta, spec.unit)
    v = apply_budgeting(v, spec.budgeting)   # if declared in III.json
    v_ = round(v, p=spec.p, tie=spec.tie_policy)
    t_ = round(t, p=spec.p, tie=spec.tie_policy)
    return compare(v_, t_, spec.relation)    # >=, >, in-band, etc.
```

**Examples (half-even).**

* $p=2$: $r_{2}(1.245)=1.24$, $r_{2}(1.255)=1.26$.
* Gate check: pass iff $\Phi' \ge \Phi'_{\min}$, where primes denote RBC-rounded values at their declared precisions.

## 2.2 Admissible observers and the observer-equivalence group $G$

**Admissible observer (plain language).**
An observer is *admissible* if they (i) follow the declared method $M$ (models, data, thresholds, budgets, scan protocol), (ii) operate within the pinned `III.json` (units, rounding, tie policy, time budgets), and (iii) restrict transformations to the **observer-equivalence group $G$**. Under these conditions, they must be able to **reproduce or defeat** the decision.

**Observer-equivalence group $G$ (definition).**
$G$ is the preregistered set of admissible re-descriptions—changes of description that preserve meaning and should not tilt the decision. Each $g\in G$ acts on both the candidate timeline and the method: $g\cdot\tau$, $g\cdot M$. The **G-floor** requires gauge invariance:
$\delta_o(g\cdot \tau;\, g\cdot M)=\delta_o(\tau; M)\quad \text{for all admissible }o\text{ and }g\in G.$

**Group axioms & scope (made explicit).**
$G$ is declared as a group under composition on the admissible domain:

* **Closure:** if $g_1,g_2\in G$ then $g_1\circ g_2\in G$.
* **Identity:** $e\in G$ with $e\cdot(\tau,M)=(\tau,M)$.
* **Inverse:** for each $g\in G$ there is $g^{-1}\in G$.
* **Domain of validity:** each class in $G$ names the inputs it applies to (e.g., “unit map applies to all numeric fields listed in `III.json` section units”). Outside its domain a transform is **not** admissible.

**What typically belongs to $G$ (declared in `III.json`).**

* **Lexical/format:** meaning-preserving paraphrase; whitespace/punctuation normalization; harmless renamings (column names, figure labels) when bound by **caption→receipt** and FIGCERT.
* **Order semantics:** reordering rows/columns **only** where the method declares order non-semantic; otherwise order changes are out of $G$.
* **Encoding/locale:** Unicode/ASCII normalization; decimal separator and thousands-separator conventions; date/time and timezone re-encodings.
* **Units/scale:** SI ↔ customary conversions with pinned formulas; sign conventions when physically equivalent.
* **Tokenization:** tokenizer/detokenizer pairs and stable segmentation variants that preserve content/effect under the method.
* **Timebase/admin:** streaming vs. batch within the preregistered TTDA parity budget; clock format/epoch re-encodings; replay order within declared tolerance windows.
* **Containers & byte layout:** CSV↔Parquet (or similar) **with pinned adapters**; endianness conversions **when explicitly declared** and receipt-checked.
* **Libraries/FP:** alternative math libraries or FP flags **only if** pinned in `III.json` and the gate inputs remain invariant after **RBC** (see §2.1).

**Non-examples (out of $G$; fail the G-floor).**

* Meaning-altering edits (added qualifiers, dropped terms, adversarial paraphrases).
* Unit changes without a pinned conversion; partial conversions that alter magnitudes.
* Timebase manipulations that exceed **TTDA** budgets (violating streaming/batch parity).
* Tokenization that changes effective content or model behavior beyond declared tolerances.
* Monotone reparameterizations that **change** the operational thresholding unless preregistered as equivalent (e.g., probit↔logit without remapping thresholds is **out of $G$**).
* Privacy/anonymization transforms that remove or perturb fields used by $M$, unless preregistered and proven neutral to the gate under **RBC**.
* Any change that exploits representation to cross a threshold **without** changing the underlying claim.

**Byte vs. semantic layers (how G-floor relates to receipts).**

* **CAPTION→RECEIPT** is a **byte-equality** layer; it does not normalize. If a $g$ change affects bytes, new receipts must be produced and linked (FIGCERT).
* **$G$-invariance** is a **semantic** layer: after applying $g$ and recomputing gate inputs under **RBC**, the decision must match. Floors **dominate** $\Phi$.

**How $G$ is enforced (G-floor sketch; details in §5).**

1. **Declare $G$** in `III.json` by **classes** of admissible transforms and their parameters (unit maps, locale maps, tokenizer family, container adapters, timebase parity, library/FP pins).
2. **Equivariance tests.** For each class, apply a **representative grid** of $g$’s and verify invariance of the **rounded** gate inputs (RBC) and the gate output.
3. **Receipt checks.** If $g$ changes bytes, regenerate **Receipt v2** (hashes, thresholds, energy, explain_url) and bind captions; byte-equality must still pass.
4. **Time governance.** Apply **TTDA** parity bounds; any exceedance is a **floor failure**, independent of $\Phi$.
5. **Supersession readiness.** If any compliant $g$ produces a defeat (floor violation or first divergence under **REPLAY-RFD**), standing is removed and the update is receipt-backed.

**Admissible observer (formal).**
Given $\tau$ and $M$, an observer $o$ is admissible iff:

* $o$ executes $M$ exactly as published (code, thresholds, budgets, scan protocol);
* uses units/rounding/tie policy declared in `III.json` (RBC, §2.1);
* limits transformations to $g\in G$; and
* publishes a **Receipt v2** with **REPLAY-RFD**.
  Then $\delta_o(\tau;M)\in{-1,0,+1}$ is **eligible to count**; any compliant counterexample (including a $g$ that defeats invariance) removes standing via **supersession**.

**Notes.**

* **Floors dominate $\Phi$.** If G-floor fails under any admissible $g$, the claim cannot pass on the basis of $\Phi$.
* **Panels/coverage** may be cited as evidence but never define “all”; **all** means *every admissible observer under* $G$ *following the method and budgets*.
* $G$ can be **extended** (e.g., spectroscopy encodings) by preregistering transforms in `III.json`; extensions must pass the same G-floor tests.

## 2.3 The pinned `III.json` manifest (budgets, thresholds, tie policy)

**Purpose.** `III.json` is the **single source of truth** for units, budgets, thresholds, rounding, tie policy, and admissible transformations. It is **pinned** (hash-bound) in receipts so an auditor can reproduce the gate exactly.

**Binding and immutability.** The manifest’s content hash appears in **Receipt v2**; **CAPTION $\to$ RECEIPT** ensures byte-equality. Within a run (or audit epoch) the manifest is **immutable**. Any change triggers **supersession** with a new receipt and a new manifest hash. The manifest defines **what counts**: floors, RBC parameters, time budgets, and the declared classes of $G$.

**Required top-level structure (skeleton).** Values below are placeholders; actual values are preregistered.

**Normative content and constraints.**

* **RBC parameters.** The `rounding.metrics` map is the authoritative location for decimal places and tie policy per metric; **relations** (`>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`) and **closure** for bands live here to avoid ambiguity. All comparisons in audits use **rounded values** per §2.1 (RBC). For notation, the rounding function can be written as $r(v; p,\text{tie})$.
* **Units and conversions.** Each numeric field binds to a **canonical unit**. Allowed unit conversions (e.g., meters↔feet) are listed in `G.units` with pinned formulas. Unit changes outside this list are not admissible.
* **Time governance (TTDA).** Pins the **Clock Disclosure Badge** (UTC, sync method, max skew), **Right-to-Temporal-Resolution** (quantizers for time-like values), **streaming/batch parity** metric and bound, and replay-order tolerance.
* **Floors (fail-closed; dominate $\Phi$).** Encodes **G-floor**, **PoS Screen**, **WITNESS** (schedules $W(n)$ and separability bounds B(n)), **CAUSALITY/ISO** (minimum $A^\star$ and cap $\hat{c}\le 1$), **CAPTION $\to$ RECEIPT** (byte-equality), and **DETERMINISM** (RNG, seed, platform parity).
* **Observer group $G$ (declaration).** Each class lists allowed transforms and **scope** (where they apply). Adapters (e.g., CSV↔Parquet) and FP libraries are listed **only if** proven invariant at the gate under RBC. $G$ must satisfy closure, identity, and inverse on its declared domain (cf. §2.2).
* **Receipts and audit.** Receipt bundle includes: manifest hash; code/data/SBOM hashes; thresholds used (printed at declared dp); energy; and `explain_url`. **REPLAY-RFD** is mandatory: **first divergence** is the stopping rule. FIGCERT binds figure captions to receipts.
* **Determinism and platform parity.** RNG algorithm and `seed` are pinned; non-deterministic kernels are either disabled or declared with bounds and tests. Platform parity (CPU/GPU, driver, library versions) is declared so auditors can match the environment.
* **NaN/undefined policy (fail closed).** Any missing threshold, NaN, or undefined comparison **fails** the check; the gate outputs a repair vector rather than proceeding.

**Minimal auditor workflow (from `III.json`).**

1. Load `III.json` and verify its hash from the receipt.
2. Canonicalize inputs per units/locale; apply time quantizers as declared.
3. Compute effective metrics (apply budgets), then apply **RBC** per `rounding.metrics`.
4. Verify **floors**; any floor failure yields $\delta=-1$.
5. If floors pass, compare $\Phi$ with $\Phi_{\min}$ and $\Phi_{\mathrm{neutral}}$ using rounded values; decide $\delta\in{-1,0,+1}$.
6. Exercise **G-floor** by sampling declared $g$ across classes; confirm invariance of rounded gate inputs and the gate output.
7. Publish an auditor Receipt v2 with the same manifest hash and attach a **REPLAY-RFD** trace to first divergence (if any).

**Change control and supersession.** No in-place edits: any change to thresholds, dp, tie policy, budgets, $G$ classes, or floor parameters requires a **version bump** and a new manifest hash. A compliant counterexample or first divergence **defeats standing**; the replacement decision cites the new manifest and receipt. Deprecated fields remain readable for audits, but the **active** fields are those in the manifest referenced by the current receipt.
