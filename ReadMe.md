I started the paper in physics initially, which is why I'm including `Gravastar.txt`, and which is why the title has the word `Gravastar` in it. 
Upon advisory from several LLM models, I've decided to abstract the paper to the highest level, which turns out to be the validation calculus level â€” `Gravastar9+`.
The paper has gone through versions 1-9. I'm only including pertinent versions.
And upon further advisory, I know that this will not be a paper and will ultimately be a book after I will finish with the anchor paper:

####  Theory of Perfection: From Principle of Superposition to Gravastar

For now, I'm working on merging `Gravastar9.md` with `Gravastar9.6.md` into `Gravastar9.6.3.md`.

`Gravastar9.md` has been reviewed by 5 AI models and they all said it was excellent and ready for final polishing.

`Gravastar9.6.md` is ChatGPT's modification of `Gravastar9.md`; 
however, upon inspection of `Gravastar9.6.md`, I didn't like how ChatGPT modified it; 
and hence, `Gravastar9.6.3.md` is the synthesized version of `Gravastar9.md` and `Gravastar9.6.md`.
