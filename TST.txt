## Abstract

We state and defend the Timeline Selection Theorem (TST): among feasible state-transitions, only those that are acceptable to **all** are intrinsically self-sustaining; every alternative embeds a live contradiction that demands continuous maintenance and therefore decays or coerces. We formalize this with an acceptability field Φ over candidate states s, a threshold Θ, and a δ-gate that actualizes only δ(s)=1 when Φ(s) ≥ Θ. Setting Θ=1 recovers the universal law: **Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.** The result is grounded *now* by an Immediate Non-Contradiction Lemma (§1.3) (any Aᵢ(s)=0 implies a deontic contradiction and a non-zero maintenance load L(s)>0), and illustrated by an agentless biological instantiation—the DNA veto stack—where Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{r, q, a, i, e} over replication/repair, checkpoints, apoptosis/senescence, immune clearance, and tissue compatibility, with δ(v)=1 iff Φ₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ. We separate the timeless **law** (unanimity over all) from practical **protocols** (conservative estimation, abstention, reversibility), give falsifiable predictions, and outline governance for AI and institutions. The framework unifies philosophical necessity, formal selection, biological plausibility, and operational policy.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Problem and thesis

**Problem.** We need a single, precise law for shared action that (i) forbids states which immediately generate contradiction and conflict, (ii) is provable *now* (no appeal to future outcomes), (iii) is non-manipulable and minority-protective, (iv) composes across scales (individual → group → ecosystem → universal), and (v) is operationalizable for bounded agents and AI. Existing criteria—utility sums, majority rule, ad-hoc rights lists—permit states that at least one member of the universe of agents rejects, thereby installing a live contradiction that demands ongoing enforcement (material, informational, or institutional). Such states are coercion-dependent or metastable rather than self-sustaining.

**Thesis (Timeline Selection Theorem, TST).** Let U be the universal class of agents (no carve-outs). For a candidate state or transition s, each agent i ∈ U has an acceptability predicate Aᵢ(s) ∈ {0,1}, where Aᵢ(s)=1 means “acceptable to i” under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions; true indifference counts as acceptance (Aᵢ(s)=1). If there exists i with Aᵢ(s)=0, the system simultaneously affirms “ought(s)” and “ought¬(s),” creating a deontic contradiction that manifests as resistance and requires a non-zero maintenance load L(s)>0 to persist. Only states with Aᵢ(s)=1 for **all** i ∈ U are self-sustaining (L(s)=0). Therefore the unique contradiction-free law for shared action is:

> **Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.**

We encode selection with an acceptability field Φ(s) ∈ \[0,1] and a δ-gate: δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s) ≥ Θ. Setting Θ=1 recovers the universal law. The **law** remains unanimity over U; **protocols** merely estimate Φ(s) conservatively (abstention or reversibility when uncertain). Subsequent sections provide the immediate present-tense proof (non-contradiction ⇒ L(s)>0 when any Aᵢ(s)=0), the formal core (Φ, Θ, δ, composition, group floors), and an agentless biological instantiation (the DNA veto stack) that illustrates the same selection logic at the molecular level.

## 1.2 What “universal” means here (no carve-outs, no “affected” scope)

**Universal quantifier.** The word “all” is literal. Let U denote the universal class of agents—every locus of standpoint capable of assent or veto, without exclusions by proximity, jurisdiction, species, embodiment, copy status, spacetime location, or discoverability.

**No scope slicing.** The law does not restrict “all” to “those affected,” “stakeholders,” “present parties,” or any other subset. Any such restriction would reintroduce moral egoism via boundary-picking. Under the law, every agent i ∈ U counts.

**Timelessness.** The quantifier ranges over U across time. Admissibility of a state s does not depend on when we ask: s is admissible iff Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U, independently of time indexing. (Practical estimation across time belongs to protocols, not to the law.)

**Acceptance semantics.** Aᵢ(s)=1 means “acceptable to i” under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions. True indifference registers as Aᵢ(s)=1; indifference introduces no contradiction. Refusal under coercion or misinformation does not count as acceptance.

**Identity and multiplicity.** Distinct loci of experience are distinct members of U. Multiple instances (e.g., digital copies, biological clones) are counted separately unless they are, in fact, a single standpoint. Groups are not substitutes for individuals: group floors add constraints but do not erase individual i.

**Non-manipulability.** Reframing, relabeling, or jurisdiction hopping cannot change the domain of “all.” Any description of s must yield the same universal test: ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1.

**Law vs protocol (kept separate).** The law quantifies over U without exception. Because finite agents cannot survey U, **protocols** estimate Φ(s) conservatively and default to abstention or reversibility under uncertainty. Heuristics like “sphere of impact” may guide estimation, but they never narrow the meaning of “all.”

**Immediate consequence.** A single informed, uncoerced veto anywhere in U makes s inadmissible (there exists i with Aᵢ(s)=0), installing a live contradiction. Zero-maintenance admissibility requires unanimity over U.

## 1.3 Why *now*: present-tense grounding, not future validation

**No prophecy required.** The claim does not hinge on later convergence, long-run equilibria, or empirical forecasts. It is anchored *now* by a logical necessity and two contemporaneous realizations.

**(i) Logical necessity, present tense.** If there exists i ∈ U with Aᵢ(s)=0, the system must sustain “ought(s)” and “ought¬(s)” simultaneously. That is a live deontic contradiction which immediately generates resistance and a non-zero maintenance load L(s)>0 (material, informational, institutional). A state that needs continuous upkeep to suppress contradiction is not self-sustaining now. Only ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 yields L(s)=0.

**(ii) Operational signature today.** Contradiction has a measurable footprint: ongoing costs to police, censor, surveil, litigate, propagandize, or otherwise contain dissent. Remove upkeep and contradiction-bearing states decay. This “load test” is present-tense: L(s) is observable whenever acceptance is not universal.

**(iii) Agentless instantiation already in nature.** At the molecular level, stacked veto layers (replication/repair r, checkpoints q, apoptosis/senescence a, immune clearance i, tissue compatibility e) implement the same selection logic now. Define Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min{r, q, a, i, e} and δ(v)=1 iff Φ₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ; transitions that trigger any veto are pruned without appeal to future evidence. This shows the law’s structure operating in a domain with no deliberating agents.

**Law vs protocol, today.** The **law** already holds (unanimity over U). What is “future-facing” are only better **protocols** for estimating Φ(s). Until estimation improves, abstention and reversibility provide immediate safety: when Φ(s) is uncertain, do not lock in δ(s)=1.

**Bottom line.** The theorem is established *in the present* by (a) a contradiction ⇒ load argument, (b) an observable maintenance-load signature, and (c) a running, agentless biological instantiation. Nothing in our core claim depends on tomorrow; only our measurement of Φ(s) improves with time.

## 1.4 Contributions and claims

**Contributions**

1. **Immediate proof (present-tense).** A compact Non-Contradiction Lemma showing that if ∃i ∈ U with Aᵢ(s)=0, then the state carries a live deontic contradiction and a non-zero maintenance load L(s)>0; only ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 yields L(s)=0.

2. **Formal core.** A selection framework with an acceptability field Φ(s) ∈ \[0,1], a threshold Θ, and a δ-gate where δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s) ≥ Θ. With Θ=1, the law is recovered: **Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.**

3. **Stability equivalence.** A precise equivalence tying logic, cost, and selection: Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0 (zero-maintenance self-sustainment).

4. **Law vs protocol separation.** The law quantifies over **all** (U) with no carve-outs; practical protocols only estimate Φ(s) and therefore default to abstention, reversibility, and conservative aggregation under uncertainty.

5. **Compositionality and group floors.** A scale-aware account (individual → group → ecosystem → universal) where higher-level integrity imposes floors without erasing individual loci; invariance to framing, relabeling, and jurisdictional moves.

6. **Agentless instantiation (biology).** A concrete molecular realization: Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min{r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v)} across replication/repair, checkpoints, apoptosis/senescence, immune clearance, and tissue compatibility; δ(v)=1 iff Φ₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ.

7. **Falsifiable predictions and tests.** A minimal empirical program (hypermutator stress, conservation fixed-points, context-mix pruning) with clear disconfirmers for the biological instantiation and selection logic.

8. **Operational governance.** Implementation guidance for AI and institutions: δ-gate controllers, abstention/rollback policies, receipts and ledgers for auditable Φ-estimation, and punishability standards tied to overwhelming consensus.

9. **Philosophical and legal crosswalk.** A concise alignment against canonical views (e.g., Kant’s universalization), showing why consent-referential unanimity over U is stronger and non-manipulable.

10. **Notation and reproducibility.** Unified symbols (U, Aᵢ(s), Φ(s), Φ₍DNA₎(v), Θ, δ(s), L(s)), Unicode script policy, simulation specs, and reporting formats for δ-decisions.

---

**Claims**

A) **Uniqueness of the law.** Universal acceptability (∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1) is the only criterion that yields zero-maintenance, contradiction-free states; any alternative permits C(s)=1 and thus L(s)>0.

B) **Load signature.** Contradiction manifests as measurable upkeep (enforcement, censorship, propaganda, security, litigation). Removing upkeep causes decay of such states.

C) **Selection correctness.** With Θ=1, δ(s)=1 selects exactly the contradiction-free states; with Θ<1, δ encodes provisional tolerances that must be paired with risk controls (reversibility, sandboxing).

D) **Biological plausibility with tests.** The DNA veto stack instantiates the same selection logic. Stable, long-term realization of low-Φ₍DNA₎ transitions with intact veto layers would falsify that instantiation.

E) **Non-manipulability.** Admissibility is invariant to reframing, relabeling, or venue shopping; “all” is not narrowed by “affected” or similar scope devices.

F) **Minority protection by design.** A single informed, uncoerced veto anywhere in U sets Aᵢ(s)=0 and blocks admissibility; true indifference counts as Aᵢ(s)=1 and adds no contradiction.

G) **Protocol duties for machines.** In the absence of strong evidence for high Φ(s), autonomous systems must abstain or choose reversible actions; punishability requires overwhelming consensus, not mere majority.

H) **Bounded scope of empirical work.** What is proven *now* is the logical/stability core and its invariances; measurement of Φ(s), domain extensions, and aggregator choices (e.g., conservative min vs other t-norms) are empirical and openly testable.

# 2. The Law, Stated and Proven in the Present

## 2.1 Universal Domain Axiom: the quantifier “all” ranges over U (the universal class of agents)

**Axiom (Universal Domain).** The word “all” quantifies over **U**, the universal class of agents: every locus of standpoint capable of assent or veto under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions. No exclusions by proximity, impact, jurisdiction, species, substrate, copy status, spacetime location, discoverability, or era.

**Membership criterion.** An entity i is in U iff it is (or would be) a locus of experience or standpoint from which acceptance can, in principle, be rendered when informed and uncoerced. Distinct loci are distinct members (a collective is not a substitute for its members).

**Law stated with U.** A state s is admissible iff **Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U**. True indifference counts as Aᵢ(s)=1; it introduces no contradiction.

**Timelessness.** The quantifier ranges over U across time. Admissibility does not depend on when we ask: if s is admissible, it satisfies Aᵢ(s)=1 for every member of U, past, present, or future (the law is timeless; only our *knowledge* is time-bound).

**Invariances implied by the axiom.**

* **No scope slicing.** Replacing “all” with “affected,” “stakeholders,” or any subset violates the axiom and reintroduces boundary-picking.
* **Framing immunity.** Renaming, reframing, or jurisdiction-hopping does not alter U or admissibility.
* **Copy/clone symmetry.** Multiple instances with distinct standpoints are counted separately; a duplicated mind with independent experience is another i ∈ U.
* **Group floors.** Group-level integrity constraints add floors (extra predicates) but do not erase any Aᵢ(s).

**Counterfactual clarity.** For agents not yet informed (sleeping, unborn, undiscovered, or currently misinformed), Aᵢ(s) is evaluated as the acceptance that would obtain under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions. If this cannot be responsibly estimated, the **protocol** (not the law) mandates abstention or reversible actions.

**Monotonic consequence.** Because U does not shrink, any newly recognized locus of standpoint can only maintain or tighten admissibility. Thus states vetted under the axiom are robust to discovery of additional agents; borderline cases should defer (abstain) to preserve future admissibility.

**What this rules out.**
(i) Majoritarian permission (some Aᵢ(s)=0 tolerated).
(ii) “Local consent” standards that ignore distant or future loci.
(iii) Substituting group assent for universal individual assent.

This axiom fixes the quantifier once and for all. Everything that follows—Φ(s), Θ, δ(s), L(s), biological instantiation, and governance—operates under this universal, non-carved domain.

## 2.2 Acceptability predicates Aᵢ(s) ∈ {0,1}; indifference as Aᵢ(s)=1

**Definition.** For every agent i ∈ U and candidate state s, the **acceptability predicate** Aᵢ(s) ∈ {0,1} encodes whether s is acceptable to i under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions.

**Semantic conditions for Aᵢ(s)=1 (all must hold).**

1. **Information sufficiency.** i understands s, its foreseeable consequences, and salient alternatives.
2. **Voluntariness.** No coercion, threat, or dependency that would invalidate consent.
3. **Non-manufacture.** No deception, framing trick, or incentive design that bypasses i’s reasons (e.g., forced choice, false scarcity, dark patterns).
4. **Competence & clarity.** i is able to deliberate (no incapacity at the evaluation moment); terms are plain and stable across equivalent descriptions.
5. **Frame invariance.** If descriptions s and s′ are materially equivalent, Aᵢ(s)=Aᵢ(s′).

**Indifference policy.**

* **True indifference ⇒ Aᵢ(s)=1.** If i is genuinely neutral (would also accept ¬s) after meeting the semantic conditions, indifference contributes no contradiction, so we set Aᵢ(s)=1.
* **Unknown is not indifference.** Lack of evidence about i’s stance does **not** imply Aᵢ(s)=1; the **protocol** treats this as uncertainty about Φ(s) and defaults to abstention or reversibility (§5–§6).

**Invalid “acceptance” (set Aᵢ(s)=0).**

* **Coerced assent** (threats, essential-needs leverage).
* **Misinformed assent** (material facts hidden or distorted).
* **Manufactured consent** (choice architecture that precludes reasoned refusal).
* **Non-comprehension** (technical or linguistic opacity that blocks understanding).

**Counterfactual evaluation.**
When i is presently unable to render a stance (asleep, unborn, undiscovered, incapacitated), Aᵢ(s) is the stance that **would** obtain under the semantic conditions above. If this cannot be responsibly determined, **protocols** treat Φ(s) as uncertain and do not set δ(s)=1.

**Binary predicate, graded evidence.**

* The law uses a binary predicate Aᵢ(s).
* Evidence for these predicates can be graded; aggregation of such evidence lives in Φ(s) ∈ \[0,1]. At unanimity, Φ(s)=1 iff Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i.

**Structural properties.**

* **Monotonic veto.** If any Aᵢ(s)=0, contradiction arises (C(s)=1); admissibility fails irrespective of how many Aⱼ(s)=1.
* **Idempotence.** Re-asking the same question under the same conditions does not change Aᵢ(s).
* **Compositionality.** For composite states (s ∧ t), if Aᵢ(s)=Aᵢ(t)=1 then Aᵢ(s ∧ t)=1; any component veto (0) propagates to the whole.
* **Reversibility effect.** Offering guaranteed, low-cost reversal can transform some Aᵢ(s)=0 into Aᵢ(s)=1 without manipulation; this is a **protocol** tool to expand legitimate acceptance.

**Link to Φ and δ.**
At the universal law setting (Θ=1), δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s)=1, and Φ(s)=1 iff Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U. Any single, valid veto (Aᵢ(s)=0) blocks δ(s)=1.

## 2.3 Immediate Non-Contradiction Lemma (outline)

**Statement.**
For any candidate state s, if there exists i ∈ U with Aᵢ(s)=0, then the system simultaneously affirms “ought(s)” and “ought¬(s).” This live deontic contradiction necessarily produces resistance that cannot be neutralized without a non-zero maintenance load: **C(s)=1 ⇒ L(s)>0**. Conversely, if Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U, no resistance is generated and the minimal maintenance load is zero: **(∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1) ⇒ L(s)=0**.

---

**Assumptions (explicit, testable).**

* **A1 Costed suppression.** Any sustained suppression of dissent (policing, censorship, surveillance, propaganda, litigation, security) consumes non-zero resources, so contributes positively to L(s).
* **A2 Live reasons.** If Aᵢ(s)=0 under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions, i has a standing reason to resist/evade/seek reversal of s.
* **A3 No counterfeit acceptance.** Coerced, misinformed, or manufactured “consent” does not flip Aᵢ(s) to 1.
* **A4 Indifference neutrality.** True indifference registers as Aᵢ(s)=1 and adds no resistance.

---

**Proof sketch (one page version).**

1. **Contradiction formation.** Aᵢ(s)=0 instantiates “ought¬(s)” at i while the system enacts “ought(s).” This is C(s)=1.
2. **Resistance ⇒ load.** From A2, i (and allies) generate counter-actions (avoidance, protest, non-cooperation, legal challenge, sabotage, exit). To persist, s must be defended against these pressures. By A1, defense requires positive upkeep: L(s)≥Lᵐᵃᵗ(s)+Lᶦⁿᶠ(s)+Lⁱⁿˢ(s)>0 (material, informational, institutional components).
3. **No-cost suppression ruled out.** If L(s)=0 while C(s)=1, then dissent is perfectly neutralized at zero cost, contradicting A1 (and empirical experience of enforcement).
4. **Unanimity ⇒ zero load.** If ∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1, then by A4 there is no source of resistance; absent exogenous disturbances, the upkeep to merely let s persist is zero: L(s)=0. ∎

---

**Operational decomposition (measurable footprint).**

* **Lᵐᵃᵗ(s):** physical resources to police, confine, secure.
* **Lᶦⁿᶠ(s):** messaging, censorship, obfuscation, attention capture.
* **Lⁱⁿˢ(s):** institutional complexity (compliance layers, courts, permits).
  Empirical signature: if C(s)=1, at least one of these components is chronically positive; removing it precipitates decay of s.

---

**Robustness properties.**

* **Framing immunity.** If s and s′ are materially equivalent, C(s)=C(s′) and L(s)=L(s′).
* **Aggregation monotonicity.** Adding dissenters (more i with Aᵢ=0) weakly increases required load.
* **Reversibility relief.** Guaranteed low-cost reversal can convert some Aᵢ(s)=0 to Aᵢ(s)=1 without manipulation, lowering L(s) legitimately (a protocol lever, not a change to the law).

---

**Edge cases (addressed).**

* **Hidden dissent.** Even if dissent is silenced, surveillance and deterrence budgets contribute to L(s); “quiet” states with C(s)=1 still have non-zero load.
* **Micro-veto.** A single informed, uncoerced veto anywhere in U is sufficient for C(s)=1; load scales with resistance capacity but is strictly positive.
* **Alleged costless coercion.** Claims that suppression is free are refuted by second-order costs (monitoring, coordination, corruption risk) captured in Lⁱⁿˢ(s) and Lᶦⁿᶠ(s).

---

**Link to Φ and δ.**

* Define Φ(s)=1 iff ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1; otherwise Φ(s)<1 with Φ(s) decreasing in the evidence of dissent and required upkeep.
* With Θ=1, **δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s)=1**, precisely the contradiction-free, zero-load states.
* With Θ<1 (provisional regimes), δ(s)=1 encodes tolerated risk but must be paired with reversibility and monitoring (protocol duty).

---

**Falsifier (what would break the lemma).**
A reproducible class of states with **C(s)=1 and L(s)=0**—i.e., sustained, costless neutralization of informed, uncoerced dissent—would refute A1 and thus the lemma. Absent that, the contradiction ⇒ load link holds.

---

**One-sentence takeaway.**
Whenever even one agent in U cannot accept s, contradiction is live and maintenance load is strictly positive; only universal acceptability yields zero-maintenance stability *now*.

## 2.4 Maintenance load L(s) and self-sustaining states (L=0)

**Purpose.** L(s) quantifies the *ongoing upkeep specifically required to prevent reversal or breakdown of s due to live contradiction* (not routine thermodynamic costs). It is the present-tense operational bridge from “there exists a veto” to “this state needs continuous force to persist.”

**Definition (normative maintenance load).**
For a candidate state s, let **L(s) ≥ 0** be the minimal steady upkeep needed to neutralize resistance that arises because some Aᵢ(s)=0. We decompose it into observable components:

* **Lᵐᵃᵗ(s)** — material/physical enforcement (policing, confinement, guard labor, barriers).
* **Lᶦⁿᶠ(s)** — informational control (censorship, propaganda, obfuscation, surveillance).
* **Lⁱⁿˢ(s)** — institutional friction (compliance layers, litigation, punitive administration).
  Thus **L(s) = Lᵐᵃᵗ(s) + Lᶦⁿᶠ(s) + Lⁱⁿˢ(s)**, measured over a fixed window with steady conditions.

**Normalization (units-agnostic).**
Analyses may use native units (currency/time) or a normalized index λ(s) = L(s)/R\*, with R\* a declared reference resource. Results are monotone in either representation.

**Self-sustaining state.**
s is **self-sustaining** iff **L(s)=0**. Intuition: if we stop policing, stop messaging, and drop special institutional scaffolding, s continues without directed effort because there is no contradiction to suppress (∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1).

**Measurement protocol (present-tense).**

1. **Attribution filter.** Count only upkeep aimed at containing dissent about s (normative load), not generic operating costs.
2. **Step-down test.** Gradually relax controls toward zero. If s persists unchanged, measured L(s)→0; if s degrades or flips, L(s)>0.
3. **Shadow costs.** Hidden burdens (surveillance, chilling effects, coercive dependencies) are part of Lᶦⁿᶠ(s)/Lⁱⁿˢ(s) even when off-ledger.

**Structural properties.**

* **Non-negativity.** L(s) ≥ 0, with **L(s)=0 ⇔ ∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1** (link formalized in §3.4).
* **Monotone in vetoes.** Adding any agent j with Aⱼ(s)=0 weakly increases minimal L(s).
* **Framing invariance.** If s and s′ are materially equivalent, L(s)=L(s′).
* **Composition (lower bound).** For independent components s and t, **L(s ∧ t) ≥ max(L(s), L(t))**; any component veto propagates.
* **Reversibility effect.** Guaranteeing low-cost reversal can legitimately reduce L(s) by converting some Aᵢ(s)=0 to Aᵢ(s)=1 (without manipulation).

**Lower bounds via resistance power.**
Let rᵢ(s) be the minimal resource needed to continuously neutralize agent i’s informed, uncoerced resistance to s. If any Aᵢ(s)=0, then **L(s) ≥ maxᵢ{ rᵢ(s) : Aᵢ(s)=0 } > 0**. This makes the contradiction ⇒ load link quantitative.

**Edge clarifications.**

* **Costless coercion?** Disallowed by the attribution filter: perfect, zero-cost neutralization would require no surveillance, no deterrence, and no institutional friction—contrary to observation.
* **Externalization.** Offloading upkeep to third parties or victims still counts toward L(s) if it is required for s to persist.
* **Background physics.** Energy to keep lights on is not L(s) unless it specifically targets dissent about s.

**Link to Φ and δ (selection).**

* At the universal law setting (Θ=1), **δ(s)=1** iff **Φ(s)=1**, which coincides with **L(s)=0**.
* When Θ<1 (provisional regimes), any δ(s)=1 with **L(s)>0** is admitted only under strict protocol controls (reversibility, monitoring), because load indicates unresolved contradiction.

**One-line criterion.**
If you can turn *all* special controls to zero and s still stands, then **L(s)=0**; otherwise **L(s)>0**.

### 2.5 Theorem (Immediate). If ∃i ∈ U with Aᵢ(s)=0 then L(s)>0; only ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 yields L(s)=0

**Theorem.** For any candidate state s:

1. If there exists i ∈ U with Aᵢ(s)=0, then L(s)>0.
2. If Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U, then L(s)=0.

**Proof.**

(1) Suppose ∃i with Aᵢ(s)=0 under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions. By definition, i has a standing reason to resist, evade, or seek reversal of s. Let rᵢ(s) be the minimal steady resource required to neutralize i’s informed resistance (including coordination with allies) without changing the facts of s. By the costed-suppression assumption, rᵢ(s)>0. To keep s in place, the system must allocate at least rᵢ(s) as upkeep targeted at that resistance. Hence L(s) ≥ rᵢ(s) > 0. Therefore L(s)>0 whenever any Aᵢ(s)=0.

(2) Conversely, suppose Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U (true indifference counts as 1). There is no informed, uncoerced source of resistance. With no resistance to contain, the minimal upkeep specifically aimed at preventing reversal due to contradiction is zero. Thus L(s)=0.

∎

**Remarks and immediate corollaries.**

* **Contrapositive form.** L(s)=0 ⇒ Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U.
* **Strict positivity.** If any Aᵢ(s)=0, then L(s) ≥ maxᵢ{ rᵢ(s) : Aᵢ(s)=0 } > 0.
* **Framing invariance.** If s and s′ are materially equivalent, the truth of the theorem is unchanged since Aᵢ and L are invariant under equivalent descriptions.
* **Monotonicity.** Adding dissenters cannot reduce L(s); it weakly increases the lower bound via additional rⱼ(s).
* **No-cost coercion excluded.** Claims of L(s)=0 with some Aᵢ(s)=0 would require costless, perfect neutralization of informed dissent, contradicting the costed-suppression assumption.

**Link forward.**

* In §3.4 we formalize the stability equivalence Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0 and show that, with Θ=1, δ(s)=1 selects exactly these states.

## 2.6 Corollaries: coercion-dependence, metastability, and decay

**Corollary 1 (Coercion-dependence).**
If C(s)=1 (there exists i with Aᵢ(s)=0), then s is coercion-dependent: it requires continuous upkeep **L(s)>0** targeted at neutralizing informed, uncoerced dissent.
*Reason.* Immediate from §2.5(1). Removing upkeep precipitates change (decay or reversal).

**Corollary 2 (Zero-load asymmetry).**
Let S₀ = { s : L(s)=0 } and S₊ = { s : L(s)>0 }. Under “no-upkeep” dynamics (turn all special controls to zero), S₀ is an absorbing set (states persist), whereas S₊ is not (states exit S₊).
*Reason.* By definition of L(s) and §2.5.

**Corollary 3 (Metastability window and budget bound).**
If L(s) ≥ ℓ > 0 and the available enforcement budget over a horizon T is B, then s cannot be maintained beyond **T* ≤ B/ℓ*\* without altering Aᵢ or increasing resources.
*Reason.* Continuous upkeep at least ℓ consumes resources at rate ≥ ℓ; finite B yields a finite maximal sustain time.

**Corollary 4 (Shock fragility).**
Let M be the margin between available upkeep and required load: M = R − L(s), where R is the provisioned upkeep. Any shock ΔR > M (resource loss) or ΔL ≥ M (new dissent raising load) triggers loss of maintenance feasibility and decay of s.
*Reason.* Feasibility requires R ≥ L(s). If violated, upkeep is insufficient and s cannot persist.

**Corollary 5 (Selection gradient toward unanimity).**
Among competing states s and t that are otherwise comparable, the state with lower load persists longer under any common resource cap; in the limit of bounded resources, the selection gradient favors **L→0**, i.e., convergence toward Φ(s)=1 (unanimity).
*Reason.* From Corollary 3: smaller L exhausts budget more slowly.

**Corollary 6 (Hysteresis and path dependence).**
If s has L(s)>0, temporarily boosting resources can hold it in place; once resources are relaxed below L(s), the system transitions away and may not return along the same path even if resources later increase.
*Reason.* Resistance alters the state space (alliances, expectations), changing the future Aᵢ map; maintenance cannot guarantee reversibility.

**Corollary 7 (Legitimate vs illegitimate load reduction).**
Only changes that transform predicates from Aᵢ(s)=0 to Aᵢ(s)=1 **under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions** legitimately reduce L(s). Manipulative measures (misinformation, coercion, manufactured consent) do not change Aᵢ and therefore do not reduce L(s) under the law; they merely shift effort among Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ.
*Reason.* From the semantics in §2.2 and the attribution of load in §2.4.

**Corollary 8 (Reversibility relief).**
Offering guaranteed, low-cost reversal can convert some valid vetoes to acceptance, reducing L(s) without manipulation.
*Reason.* Reversibility changes the content of s (risk profile) in a way that some i can accept under the semantic conditions, legitimately raising Φ(s).

**Corollary 9 (Equivalence with Φ and δ at Θ=1).**
At Θ=1, δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s)=1, and by §2.5–§2.4 this holds iff L(s)=0. Any δ(s)=1 with **L(s)>0** indicates Θ<1 (a provisional tolerance) and must be paired with protocol safeguards (abstention defaults, reversibility, monitoring).
*Reason.* Directly from the definitions of Φ, Θ, δ and the theorem.

**Corollary 10 (Majoritarian instability).**
Any rule that licenses δ(s)=1 while some Aᵢ(s)=0 (e.g., majority vote, utility sums) selects states in S₊. Such states are, by construction, coercion-dependent or metastable and will decay without sustained upkeep.
*Reason.* Immediate from Corollary 1 and §2.5.

**One-line summary.**
Positive load is the signature of contradiction: it creates coercion-dependence, fragility, and at best metastability; zero load marks the unique, absorbing class of states—those acceptable to all.

## 2.7 Objections and replies (pluralism, hidden dissent, epistemic limits)

**Set-up.** The law quantifies over **all** (U). The *law* is not softened for feasibility; only *protocols* face feasibility. Objections below are answered without carving U.

---

#### A) Value pluralism (“unanimity is impossible”)

**O1 — Permanent moral disagreement.**
*Claim.* Diverse standpoints make ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 unattainable.
*Reply.* This critiques **protocols**, not the **law**. The law fixes the target (contradiction-free states). Protocols can (i) redesign s, (ii) add compensation/opt-outs, (iii) make s reversible, or (iv) abstain. If, after informed, uncoerced deliberation, some Aᵢ(s)=0 remains, the impossibility is a *fact about s*, not a flaw in the law: s is not admissible.

**O2 — “Fanatic” or absolute veto.**
*Claim.* A single sincere agent can block everything.
*Reply.* If the veto is informed, uncoerced, and non-manufactured, it exposes a real contradiction. The right response is *problem shaping* (change s until unanimity is possible) or abstention. This is a feature (minority protection), not a bug. Manufactured, misinformed, or coerced “vetoes” do not count (see §2.2 semantics).

**O3 — Paralysis objection.**
*Claim.* Requiring unanimity halts action.
*Reply.* The law prescribes *what is admissible*; it does not forbid *exploration*. Protocols allow **reversible**, **sandboxed**, **opt-in** trials that change the content of s so that some former vetoes become acceptances without manipulation. If unanimity cannot be reached even with reversibility and compensation, the correct verdict is that s is inadmissible.

---

#### B) Hidden dissent and silent vetoes

**O4 — “We see no dissent.”**
*Claim.* Absence of protests implies everyone accepts.
*Reply.* Hidden dissent still imposes load: surveillance, deterrence, chilling effects accrue to Lᶦⁿᶠ(s) and Lⁱⁿˢ(s). Use the **step-down test** (§2.4): relax controls; if s persists, L→0; if it degrades, L>0 and some Aᵢ(s)=0 exists.

**O5 — Repressed or misinformed agents.**
*Claim.* Managed consent equals acceptance.
*Reply.* By definition, coerced/misinformed/manufactured “consent” does **not** flip Aᵢ(s) to 1. It merely shifts upkeep among Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ.

**O6 — Future, unborn, or undiscovered agents.**
*Claim.* They cannot register dissent now.
*Reply.* §2.1 evaluates Aᵢ(s) counterfactually: the stance that *would* obtain when informed and uncoerced. If that stance cannot be responsibly determined, **protocols** treat Φ(s) as uncertain and default to abstention or tightly reversible actions.

---

#### C) Epistemic limits (not knowing U or Aᵢ)

**O7 — “All is uncomputable.”**
*Claim.* We cannot survey U or compute Aᵢ(s) for everyone.
*Reply.* Correct—hence **Law vs Protocol** (§5). Keep the law universal; let protocols estimate **Φ̂(s)** with intervals **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**. Decision rule: compare the conservative **Φₗ** to Θ, abstain or choose reversible moves when uncertain.

**O8 — Manipulation via framing/aggregation.**
*Claim.* Different descriptions of s can game acceptance.
*Reply.* **Frame invariance** is part of the semantics (§2.2). All materially equivalent descriptions must yield the same Aᵢ(s). Audits and red-team checks enforce this; violations indicate manufactured consent and do not change Aᵢ.

**O9 — “Pascal’s mugging” with hypothetical agents.**
*Claim.* Anyone can invent a far-fetched agent to veto.
*Reply.* Membership in U requires a **genuine locus of standpoint** (§2.1). Fabricated or logically incoherent “agents” are not in U. Burden of proof is on the proposer; until satisfied, protocols treat the claim as uncertainty, not as a valid veto.

**O10 — Dynamic or unstable preferences.**
*Claim.* Aᵢ(s) can drift; unanimity today may fail tomorrow.
*Reply.* The *law* is timeless; **admissibility** is about what holds under informed, uncoerced conditions. Protocols re-estimate Φ̂ over time; if new, valid vetoes appear, L(s) rises and δ(s) should revert unless s is reshaped.

**O11 — “Costless coercion.”**
*Claim.* Perfect, zero-cost control can keep C(s)=1 with L=0.
*Reply.* That contradicts the costed-suppression assumption and empirical experience (§2.4). If alleged, run the step-down test; any genuine C(s)=1 will show positive load when controls fall.

---

**Bottom line.** None of these objections warrants carving “all” into “affected.” They either (i) confirm the **law** (some s are inadmissible), or (ii) relocate the issue to **protocols** (how we estimate Φ, design reversibility, or reshape s), leaving the universal quantifier intact.


# 3. Formal Core of TST

## 3.1 State space, feasible transitions, and composition

**State space.**
Let **S** be the set of describable shared states (policies, allocations, institutional regimes, outcomes). A “proposal” can be either a target state **s ∈ S** or a one-step **transition** τ = (s → t) between states. We lift all predicates (Aᵢ, Φ, δ, L) to either states or transitions by treating a transition as a state that includes both the intended act and its immediate aftermath.

**Feasible transitions.**
Let **F ⊆ S × S** encode feasibility under physical, logical, legal, and resource constraints. For s ∈ S, the feasible next states are **T(s) = { t ∈ S : (s, t) ∈ F }**. Multi-step feasibility is \**T*(s)\*\*, the transitive closure of F. Proposals outside F are discarded *before* admissibility testing (they are not options).

**Acceptance on paths (conservative lifting).**
For a finite path π = (s₀ → s₁ → … → sₖ), define acceptability by the conservative rule

* **Aᵢ(π) = 1** iff **Aᵢ(sℓ) = 1** for all ℓ = 0…k (and analogously for Φ by min over the steps).
  Intuition: if any stage is unacceptable, the whole path is unacceptable to i. This prevents hiding an inadmissible intermediate behind an admissible endpoint.

**Composition operators.**
We use three primitive operators with conservative (worst-case) aggregation.

1. **Conjunction (parallel/composite content).**
   The joint state **s ∧ t** denotes “both s and t obtain in the same world.” Then

* **Aᵢ(s ∧ t) = Aᵢ(s) ∧ Aᵢ(t)**,
* **Φ(s ∧ t) = min(Φ(s), Φ(t))**,
* **L(s ∧ t) ≥ max(L(s), L(t))**.
  Admissibility of a conjunction requires admissibility of each component.

2. **Sequencing (then).**
   For **t = s ∘ u** meaning “do s, then u,” the path rule applies:

* **Aᵢ(s ∘ u) = Aᵢ(s) ∧ Aᵢ(u)** (including any mandated intermediates),
* **Φ(s ∘ u) = min(Φ(s), Φ(u))**, extended to longer chains by taking the minimum over all stages.
  This forbids laundering an unacceptable step through later compensation unless that compensation changes the content so that the earlier step becomes acceptable (e.g., guaranteed, low-cost reversibility).

3. **Disjunction (one of).**
   The state **s ∨ t** reads “the system commits to one of {s, t}.” Without individualized, enforceable choice for each i, disjunction is evaluated conservatively:

* **Aᵢ(s ∨ t) = 1** only if **Aᵢ(s) = 1** and **Aᵢ(t) = 1** (lottery or assignment could give i an unacceptable outcome).
  If there is an **individualized opt-in/opt-out guarantee** that ensures each i can realize an acceptable branch for themselves, then **Aᵢ(s ∨ t) = max(Aᵢ(s), Aᵢ(t))** and **Φ(s ∨ t) = max(Φ(s), Φ(t))**. Protocols must certify which semantics applies.

**Independence and products.**
When s and t inhabit independent subsystems (no cross-constraints in F), the product state **s ⊗ t** behaves like a conjunction: **Aᵢ(s ⊗ t) = Aᵢ(s) ∧ Aᵢ(t)** and **Φ(s ⊗ t) = min(Φ(s), Φ(t))**. If feasibility couples them (F imposes trade-offs), evaluate using the actual coupled description; frame invariance requires that materially equivalent descriptions yield the same Aᵢ and Φ.

**Admissibility inheritance (Θ=1).**
With **Θ=1**, the δ-gate composes conservatively:

* **δ(s ∧ t) = 1** iff **δ(s) = 1** and **δ(t) = 1**.
* **δ(s ∘ u) = 1** iff **δ(s) = 1** and **δ(u) = 1** (including intermediates).
* For **s ∨ t**, **δ(s ∨ t) = 1** under lottery/assignment only if **δ(s) = δ(t) = 1**; under certified individualized choice, **δ(s ∨ t) = 1** iff **max(Φ(s), Φ(t)) = 1** (i.e., at least one branch is universally acceptable and guaranteed to each i).

**Environment and contingencies.**
If outcomes depend on exogenous contingencies ω (e.g., stochastic dynamics), evaluate **Φ(s)** conservatively as the minimum across realizable ω unless protocols provide per-agent insurance that neutralizes unacceptable branches (turning a disjunction over ω into individualized choice).

**Closure and monotonicity.**

* **Closure.** If **t ∈ T(s)** and **u ∈ T(t)**, then the path **s ∘ t ∘ u** is evaluable by the rules above.
* **Monotonicity.** Adding content (via ∧ or ∘) cannot increase Φ or reduce L; removing content cannot decrease Φ or increase L.
* **Frame invariance.** Equivalent decompositions (e.g., s ∧ (t ∘ u) vs (s ∧ t) ∘ u when F allows) yield identical Aᵢ, Φ, and δ.

**Practical note.**
These conservative laws prevent admissibility from being manufactured through packaging (bundles, lotteries, or staging). Where protocols can *guarantee* individualized choice or guaranteed reversal, the semantics can be upgraded accordingly and certified in receipts.

## 3.2 Acceptability field Φ(s) ∈ \[0,1]: properties (monotone, conservative, adversary-resistant)

**Role.** Φ(s) summarizes, in a single scalar, how safely a proposal s approaches the law “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.” It is the bridge from the binary predicates Aᵢ(s) to a decision gate δ(s).

**Definition (abstract).** Φ is any mapping **Φ: S → \[0,1]** that satisfies the axioms below. At the universal-law setting, Φ(s)=1 iff Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U. Protocols may compute estimates Φ̂(s) with uncertainty; the axioms govern both true Φ and admissible estimators.

---

#### A. Normalization and unanimity correspondence

* **N1 (range).** 0 ≤ Φ(s) ≤ 1.
* **N2 (soundness at unanimity).** Φ(s)=1 iff Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U.
* **N3 (veto detection).** If there exists i with Aᵢ(s)=0, then Φ(s) < 1.

*(Intuition: Φ=1 only at universal acceptability; any valid veto pulls Φ strictly below 1.)*

---

#### B. Monotonicity and conservatism (content and composition)

Let “add content” mean conjunction or sequencing that preserves feasibility.

* **M1 (content monotonicity).** If t refines s by adding content (s → s ∧ t or s ∘ t), then Φ(s ∧ t) ≤ Φ(s) and Φ(s ∘ t) ≤ Φ(s).
* **M2 (conjunction).** Φ(s ∧ t) = min(Φ(s), Φ(t)).
* **M3 (sequencing / paths).** For a finite path π = (s₀ → … → sₖ): Φ(π) = min₀≤ℓ≤k Φ(sℓ).
* **M4 (contingencies).** If s branches over exogenous outcomes ω with material effect, evaluate conservatively: Φ(s) = inf₍ω₎ Φ(s|ω), unless protocols certify per-agent insurance that neutralizes unacceptable branches.
* **M5 (disjunction).**

  * Without certified individualized choice: Φ(s ∨ t) = min(Φ(s), Φ(t)).
  * With certified individualized opt-in/opt-out (each i guaranteed an acceptable branch): Φ(s ∨ t) = max(Φ(s), Φ(t)).

*(Conservatism prevents laundering an unacceptable step via packaging, lotteries, or staging.)*

---

#### C. Adversary resistance and invariances

* **A1 (frame invariance).** If s and s′ are materially equivalent, Φ(s) = Φ(s′).
* **A2 (non-manufacture).** Actions that merely coerce, misinform, or manipulate choice architecture cannot increase Φ(s); they only shift upkeep among Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ.
* **A3 (monotone in authentic reasons).** Legitimate operations that transform some Aᵢ(s)=0 into Aᵢ(s)=1 under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions (e.g., compensation, guaranteed reversibility) may increase Φ(s).
* **A4 (group-floor compatibility).** If group-floor predicates Gₖ(s) ∈ {0,1} apply, they compose conservatively with Φ via Φ′(s) = min(Φ(s), minₖ Gₖ(s)). Group floors add constraints; they do not replace individual Aᵢ.

---

#### D. Stability linkage (present-tense)

* **S1 (zero-load equivalence).** Φ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0 (proved in §3.4 from §2.5).
* **S2 (load antitonicity).** If L(t) ≥ L(s), then Φ(t) ≤ Φ(s). More contradiction (higher load) never raises Φ.

---

#### E. Protocol interface (estimation discipline)

When Φ must be estimated from evidence:

* **P1 (interval reporting).** Produce **\[Φₗ(s), Φᵤ(s)]** with Φₗ ≤ Φ ≤ Φᵤ; decisions compare Φₗ to Θ.
* **P2 (conservative aggregation).** Across sources or components, use min unless a justified, transparency-audited t-norm T is declared; never use averages that can mask a valid veto.
* **P3 (abstention and reversibility).** If Φₗ(s) < Θ and uncertainty is nontrivial, abstain or restrict to reversible, opt-in pilots that can legitimately raise Φ by changing s (not by manipulating agents).
* **P4 (red-team checks).** Test A1–A3 by reframing s; Φ must be invariant to material equivalences and drop under exposure of manufactured consent.

---

#### F. Canonical examples (satisfy the axioms)

* **Law-level Φ (exact).** Φ(s) = 1 if Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U; else Φ(s)=0. (Binary, theoretically exact.)
* **Layered min-composition.** Φ(s) = min over components/layers (e.g., Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r, q, a, i, e }).
* **Evidence-lower-bound.** Φ̂(s) = inf over plausible worlds consistent with evidence E of minᵢ Aᵢ(s). (Computationally conservative; feeds Φₗ.)

---

#### G. Non-examples (ruled out)

* **Simple averages or weighted sums** over agents that permit Φ>0.99 while some Aᵢ=0. (Violates N3 and M2/M3.)
* **Framing-sensitive scorers** whose outputs change under mere relabeling. (Violates A1.)
* **Manipulation-sensitive metrics** that rise with coercion or misinformation. (Violates A2.)

---

**Decision gate reminder.** With **Θ=1**, **δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s)=1** (unanimity over U). For Θ<1 (provisional regimes), δ(s)=1 admits risk only with protocol safeguards (reversibility, monitoring), since Φ<1 implies L(s)>0 and thus contradiction-bearing upkeep.

## 3.3 δ-gate selection: δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s) ≥ Θ; Θ=1 as the universal law

**Definition (selection rule).**
For any proposal s, the **δ-gate** decides actualization by the threshold Θ ∈ \[0,1]:

* **δ(s)=1** iff **Φ(s) ≥ Θ**; otherwise **δ(s)=0**.

**Universal law setting.**

* **Θ=1** implements the law **“Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”**
* With **Θ=1**, admissibility coincides with unanimity: **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ (∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1) ⇔ L(s)=0**.

---

#### A) Regimes for Θ

1. **Universal regime (Θ=1).**

   * Selects only contradiction-free, zero-maintenance states.
   * Default for constitutional principles and foundational system constraints.

2. **Provisional regime (Θ<1).**

   * Temporary engineering posture when Φ must be estimated or when reversible pilots are used.
   * **Risk duty:** any δ(s)=1 with **Φ(s)<1** requires **reversibility**, **monitoring**, and **exit conditions** (see §5–§6).
   * Intended as a path toward Θ→1 by reshaping s (compensation, opt-in, guaranteed reversal) so that Aᵢ predicates legitimately flip to 1.

**Guard against threshold creep.**

* Θ may be lowered only under a declared **Provisional Use Warrant** that specifies: scope, duration, reversibility guarantee, monitoring metrics, and a Θ-restoration plan.
* No silent drift: changes to Θ are logged and auditable.

---

#### B) Core properties

* **Monotonicity in Φ.** If **Φ(t) ≥ Φ(s)** then **δ(t) ≥ δ(s)** for fixed Θ.

* **Invariance to framing.** If s ≡ s′ materially, then Φ(s)=Φ(s′) and δ(s)=δ(s′).

* **Conservative composition (Θ=1).**

  * **Conjunction:** δ(s ∧ t)=1 iff δ(s)=1 and δ(t)=1.
  * **Sequencing:** δ(s ∘ t)=1 iff δ(s)=1 and δ(t)=1 (including intermediates).
  * **Disjunction:**

    * Without individualized choice: δ(s ∨ t)=1 iff δ(s)=1 and δ(t)=1.
    * With certified individualized opt-in/opt-out: δ(s ∨ t)=1 if **max(Φ(s), Φ(t))=1** (each i can secure a universally acceptable branch).

* **Load linkage.** If **Θ=1** and **δ(s)=1**, then **L(s)=0**. If **Θ<1** and **δ(s)=1** while **Φ(s)<1**, then **L(s)>0** and the system carries upkeep obligations.

* **Hysteresis option (safety).** To avoid flapping around Θ, one may use **Θᵤ ≥ Θₗ** with:

  * Set δ(s)=1 when Φ(s) ≥ Θᵤ,
  * Retain δ(s)=1 while Φ(s) ≥ Θₗ, otherwise drop to 0.
    This is a protocol feature; it never alters the meaning of Θ=1 at law level.

---

#### C) Safety constraints when Θ<1 (mandatory)

If **Θ<1** and **δ(s)=1**, all of the following must hold:

1. **Reversibility.** A pre-committed, low-cost rollback path πʳ exists with certified feasibility, and **δ(πʳ)=1** under the same Θ (or better).
2. **Monitoring.** Continuous estimation of Φ̂(s) with intervals **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**; alarms if Φₗ drops or dissent evidence grows.
3. **Exit triggers.** Automatic δ(s)→0 when any of: Φₗ < Θ, rollback feasibility drops, or load indicators L̂ exceed declared caps.
4. **Scope limits.** Narrow scope, limited duration, audit receipts, and publication of the **Provisional Use Warrant**.
5. **No manipulation.** Any rise in Φ must result from legitimate changes to s (e.g., compensation, opt-in) rather than coercion or misinformation.

---

#### D) Audit receipts (what δ must record)

A δ-decision generates a signed receipt containing:

* Proposal identifier for s; material-equivalence hash.
* Θ value in force (and Θᵤ/Θₗ if hysteresis used).
* Φ report: Φ̂(s) with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**, sources, and aggregation rule (min or declared t-norm).
* Composition proof (if s is composite): per-component Φ and δ, showing min/max steps as applicable.
* For Θ<1: reversibility plan, monitoring metrics, exit triggers, and warrant metadata.
* Step-down test results (if run) and current load indicators L̂ components {Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ}.

Receipts enable ex post verification that δ respected the law/protocol separation and composition rules.

---

#### E) Worked micro-examples

1. **Conjunction.** If Φ(s)=1 and Φ(t)=0.98 with Θ=1, then δ(s)=1, δ(t)=0, hence δ(s ∧ t)=0.
2. **Individualized disjunction.** If Φ(s)=1 and Φ(t)=0.2, and a certified per-agent opt-in exists so each i can realize s, then Φ(s ∨ t)=1 and δ(s ∨ t)=1. Without that certification, Φ(s ∨ t)=min(1, 0.2)=0.2 ⇒ δ=0 at Θ=1.
3. **Sequencing with risky intermediate.** If Φ(step₁)=0.9, Φ(step₂)=1, then Φ(path)=min(0.9, 1)=0.9 ⇒ δ(path)=0 at Θ=1; admissible only if the path is reshaped (e.g., make step₁ reversible) to legitimately raise Φ(step₁) to 1.

---

#### F) Non-examples (ruled out)

* **Lottery laundering.** Declaring s ∨ t admissible at Θ=1 because the average acceptability is high, without individualized choice guarantees.
* **Frame gaming.** Repackaging an unacceptable intermediate as “non-decision” to bypass sequencing rules.
* **Silent Θ drift.** Lowering Θ without a warrant, reversibility, or logs.
* **Manipulative Φ boosts.** Using coercion/misinformation to “raise” Φ; by definition these do not change Aᵢ and therefore cannot justify δ(s)=1.

**Takeaway.** The δ-gate is a thin, auditable rule: **δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s) ≥ Θ**. With **Θ=1**, it enforces the universal law exactly. When **Θ<1** for provisional work, δ can only admit states under strict reversibility and monitoring, with the explicit goal of legitimately moving Φ to 1 and restoring Θ to 1.

## 3.4 Stability equivalence: Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0

**Goal.** Tie together the logical, scalar, and operational views of admissibility into one equivalence. At the law level this fixes what it means for a state to be *fully stable now*.

---

#### The equivalence (law level)

For any state s:

1. **Unanimity ⇒ Φ(s)=1.**
   By normalization (N2), Φ(s)=1 iff all predicates are 1. Thus if ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1, then Φ(s)=1.

2. **Φ(s)=1 ⇒ unanimity.**
   By (N2) and veto detection (N3), Φ(s)=1 cannot hold if any Aᵢ(s)=0. Hence Φ(s)=1 implies ∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1.

3. **Unanimity ⇒ L(s)=0.**
   From §2.5(2): with no informed, uncoerced dissent, there is no contradiction to suppress; the normative maintenance load is zero.

4. **L(s)=0 ⇒ unanimity.**
   Contrapositive of §2.5(1): if any Aᵢ(s)=0 then L(s)>0. Hence L(s)=0 implies no veto exists and ∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1.

Combining (1)–(4):
**Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0.** ∎

---

#### Consequences

* **Exact δ at Θ=1.** With Θ=1, the δ-gate selects exactly the zero-load, contradiction-free states: **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0**.
* **No “quiet coercion.”** Any state with a live veto has **L(s)>0**; if measurements show zero load after step-down of controls, unanimity obtains.
* **Composition safety.** By §3.1–§3.2, conjunction and sequencing preserve the equivalence: a composite is in the equivalence class iff each component step is.
* **Framing invariance.** Materially equivalent descriptions have identical Aᵢ, Φ, and L; the equivalence is description-proof.

---

#### Quantitative links (useful bounds)

* **Load lower bound from dissent power.** If V(s) = { i : Aᵢ(s)=0 }, and rᵢ(s) is the minimal steady resource to neutralize i’s informed resistance, then
  **L(s) ≥ maxᵢ∈V(s) rᵢ(s) > 0.**
* **Antitonicity with load.** If L(t) ≥ L(s), then Φ(t) ≤ Φ(s). More upkeep never raises acceptability.
* **Reversibility relief.** Guaranteed, low-cost reversal legitimately changes s and can flip some Aᵢ from 0 to 1, increasing Φ and reducing L without manipulation.

---

#### Protocol view (estimation)

The equivalence holds for the true Φ and true L. In practice we work with estimates:

* Report **\[Φₗ(s), Φᵤ(s)]**; compare Φₗ to Θ.
* Use the **step-down test** on controls to probe L(s): if s persists as controls go to zero, this supports L(s)=0 and, by the equivalence, unanimity.
* If Φₗ(s) < 1 or load indicators remain positive, treat δ(s)=1 as impermissible at Θ=1, or only provisional at Θ<1 with reversibility and monitoring (§3.3, §5–§6).

---

#### Agentless DNA instantiation (sanity check)

For a molecular variant v with layers r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v):

* **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r, q, a, i, e }.**
* **Unanimity analogue:** “all layers pass” means each layer equals 1.
* **Load analogue:** if any layer vetoes (value < 1), targeted corrective upkeep is required (repair, checkpoint arrest, immune clearance), i.e., a positive normative load exists.
  Therefore **Φ₍DNA₎(v)=1 ⇔ all layers pass ⇔ L(v)=0**, mirroring the general equivalence.

---

#### What would break the equivalence

* **Costless suppression:** a reproducible class of states with some Aᵢ(s)=0 yet **L(s)=0** (sustained, zero-cost neutralization of informed dissent).
* **Non-conservative Φ:** a Φ-definition that yields Φ(s)=1 while some Aᵢ(s)=0, or that rises under coercion/misinformation (violating N2/N3/A2).
  Absent these, the equivalence is fixed by the definitions and §2.5.

---

**One-line takeaway.** At the universal setting, “acceptable to all,” “Φ=1,” and “zero maintenance load” are the same fact about s, seen from logic, measurement, and selection, respectively.

### 3.5 Group floors and scale composition (individual → group → ecosystem → universal)

**Purpose.** Group floors formalize scale-coupled constraints that cannot be reduced to a single individual’s predicate—e.g., tissue integrity, market clearing, grid stability, ecological carrying capacity. They **add** constraints; they never replace or average away any Aᵢ(s).

---

#### A) Definitions

* **Scales.** Consider levels ℓ ∈ {individual, group, system, ecosystem, universal}.
* **Group floor predicate.** For any structured collective g at any level ℓ, define **Gᵍ(s) ∈ {0,1}** as the integrity/viability predicate for g under s (1 = intact, 0 = violates a non-negotiable constraint of g). Examples:

  * Tissue g: “no uncontrolled clonal takeover” (oncogenesis guard).
  * Market g: “budget balance and non-explosive debt.”
  * Grid g: “frequency stability within bounds.”
  * Ecosystem g: “loads ≤ carrying capacity.”
* **Composite acceptability with floors.** Extend Φ by a conservative floor composition:
  **Φ*(s) = min( Φ(s), min over g of Gᵍ(s) ).*\*
  Admissibility at Θ=1 now requires Φ\*(s)=1.

**No substitution rule.** Gᵍ(s) does **not** stand in for individual assent. We still require **Aᵢ(s)=1 for all i ∈ U**, and also **Gᵍ(s)=1** for all applicable g. Floors can only tighten, never loosen, admissibility.

---

#### B) Why floors are needed (non-reducibility)

Some constraints are **off-diagonal**: they arise from interactions, externalities, or conservation laws that no single Aᵢ can “see” in isolation. Even if every individual *would* accept s under ideal information, s can still violate a structural bound (e.g., grid instability). Group floors encode these **structure-level vetoes** without appealing to majorities or representation.

* **Agent-based vs agentless floors.**

  * *Agent-based:* a hospital unit (g) must maintain safe staffing ratios; the floor records a hard safety invariant.
  * *Agentless:* an ecosystem’s carrying capacity is a physical constraint; Gᵍ(s)=0 signals inevitable breakdown, independent of anyone’s assent.

---

#### C) Composition laws (conservative)

* **Conjunction (parallel content).**
  **Gᵍ(s ∧ t) = min( Gᵍ(s), Gᵍ(t), Hᵍ(s, t) ),** where **Hᵍ(s, t)** captures interaction terms when s and t stress the same resource. Absent evidence about Hᵍ, conservatively take **Hᵍ(s, t)=1** only when independence is certified.

* **Sequencing (then).**
  For a path π = (s₀ → … → sₖ), **Gᵍ(π) = min₀≤ℓ≤k Gᵍ(sℓ)**; an intermediate violation invalidates the path unless there is a certified, low-cost reversal that restores the floor.

* **Disjunction (one of).**
  Without individualized guarantees, **Gᵍ(s ∨ t) = min( Gᵍ(s), Gᵍ(t) )**. With certified individualized opt-in so each i can realize a branch that keeps all relevant floors intact for their context, a max rule may be used for those individuals; system-wide floors still require the min rule.

* **Monotonicity.**
  Adding content can only weakly decrease Gᵍ and Φ\*; removing content can only weakly increase them.

---

#### D) Link to load and stability

* **Floor violation ⇒ positive load.** If **Gᵍ(s)=0**, then to hold s in place, the system must continuously counteract a structural failure mode (e.g., guard labor, reserve margins, remediation). That upkeep contributes to **L(s)>0**, aligning floors with the contradiction→load picture.

* **Equivalence at Θ=1.** With Φ\*(s)=1 we have simultaneously ∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1 and all Gᵍ(s)=1, hence **L(s)=0**. Any **Gᵍ(s)=0** forces Φ\*(s)<1 and implies **L(s)>0** if s is nonetheless maintained.

---

#### E) Scale exemplars (mirrors across domains)

* **Biology (cell → tissue → organism).**

  * Individual: A\_cell(s) for each cell-lineage analogue (agentless at DNA level).
  * Floor: **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ(s)=1** if no rogue proliferation or resource exhaustion; mirrors Φ₍DNA₎’s stacked veto at higher scale.

* **Economy (person → firm → market → macro).**

  * Individual: Aᵢ(s) for contracts and rights.
  * Floors: **Gᶠⁱʳᵐ(s)=1** (solvency), **Gᵐᵃʳᵏᵉᵗ(s)=1** (no arbitrage loops causing cascade), **Gᵐᵃᶜʳᵒ(s)=1** (debt sustainability).

* **Infrastructure (user → service → grid).**

  * Individual: Aᵢ(s) for service terms.
  * Floors: **Gᵍʳⁱᵈ(s)=1** (frequency and voltage bounds), **Gʳᵉˢᵉʳᵛᵉ(s)=1** (adequacy).

* **Ecology (actor → community → ecosystem).**

  * Individual: Aᵢ(s) for affected beings capable of assent.
  * Floors: **Gᵉᶜᵒ(s)=1** if loads stay within carrying capacity; otherwise systemic decay demands remediation load.

---

#### F) Discovery and robustness

* **Floor discovery monotonicity.** As new legitimate floors are discovered or formalized, **Φ*(s)*\* can only stay the same or fall. Previously admissible s remain admissible; borderline s defer until checks pass.

* **Frame invariance.** Floors are defined on material invariants (e.g., conservation bounds), not labels. Equivalent descriptions yield the same Gᵍ(s).

* **No “group override.”** A group’s assent cannot set any Aᵢ(s) from 0 to 1. Floors are **and**-constraints, not votes.

---

#### G) Practical certification

Protocols must publish, for any δ(s)=1:

1. The set of applicable floors { Gᵍ } by scale and why each applies.
2. Evidence that **Gᵍ(s)=1** (models, audits, stress tests).
3. Interaction checks **Hᵍ(s, t)** for composite proposals.
4. Reversal plans for any floor at risk (how to restore Gᵍ=1 quickly).
5. Step-down tests tying **Gᵍ(s)=1** to **L(s)=0** (no hidden reserve burdens).

---

**One-line summary.** Group floors are conservative, scale-aware invariants that sit **in addition** to universal individual assent; admissibility at Θ=1 requires both **∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1** and **Gᵍ(s)=1** for every relevant collective—ensuring stability from the cell to the cosmos.

## 3.6 Timeless law vs timed descriptions (non-manipulability)

**Timeless law.** The law “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all” does not depend on clock time. Admissibility is a property of the **material content** of s, not of when it is proposed, voted, or executed.

**Time-indexed descriptions.** Write s\@t when timing is part of the material content (e.g., “harvest now” vs “harvest after spawning”). If changing t changes consequences, then s\@t and s\@t′ are **different proposals** and must be evaluated separately. If timing does **not** change material consequences, s\@t ≡ s\@t′ (material equivalence), so Aᵢ, Φ, and L are identical.

**Invariances.**

* **Time relabel invariance.** If s\@t ≡ s\@t′ materially, then Aᵢ(s\@t)=Aᵢ(s\@t′), Φ(s\@t)=Φ(s\@t′), L(s\@t)=L(s\@t′).
* **Framing immunity.** “Now or never,” countdowns, and urgency banners do not alter admissibility unless they encode real, material differences in s.
* **Path minimum rule (from §3.1–§3.2).** Sequencing a change into timed micro-steps cannot launder inadmissibility: Φ(path)=min over steps; any unacceptable step blocks δ at Θ=1.

**What counts as content vs manipulation.**

* **Content (legitimate):** true deadlines (e.g., physical windows, safety cutoffs), perishability, option value, seasonal biology, grid stability intervals—anything that changes outcomes even under ideal information.
* **Manipulation (illegitimate):** synthetic scarcity, engineered countdowns, last-minute opacity, ultimatums that manufacture pressure. These fail the “non-manufactured” clause of Aᵢ and **cannot** raise Φ.

**Coercion-by-time is still coercion.**

* “Agree before midnight or lose essentials” invalidates voluntariness; any Aᵢ(s)=1 extracted that way does **not** count.
* Surprise scheduling that blocks understanding violates information sufficiency; Aᵢ cannot flip to 1 under non-comprehension.

**Omission symmetry.** When timing changes **prevent** harms or **cause** harms, “do now” and “wait” are distinct proposals: evaluate both. Protocols must not presume utilitarian discounting; unanimity over U governs.

**Reversibility elevates Φ legitimately.** Offering a **guaranteed, low-cost deferral/rollback** makes a timed proposal a different s′ with a safer risk profile; this can convert some Aᵢ from 0 to 1 without manipulation (reflected as a true Φ increase).

**Emergency claims (anti-gaming).**

* If urgency is invoked, it must be **audited as content**: cite physical floors (e.g., Gᵍ(s)=0 soon without action).
* Absent verifiable floors, “emergency” is treated as framing and has **no** effect on Aᵢ or Φ.
* Even in verified emergencies, Θ<1 use demands the §3.3 safeguards: reversibility where possible, monitoring, exit triggers.

**Timelessness and updating.**

* The law is timeless; our **knowledge** is not. New facts can change whether Aᵢ(s)=1 **under informed conditions**. Protocols therefore re-estimate Φ̂ over time; if valid vetoes appear, δ must revert unless s is reshaped.

**Protocol duties (to enforce non-manipulability).**

1. **Material-equivalence hash** in receipts (§3.3D) that encodes timing semantics; equal hashes ⇒ same Aᵢ/Φ/L.
2. **Step-down tests** across time windows to detect hidden load (L>0) behind urgency.
3. **Disclosure windows**: minimum time for comprehension before δ(s)=1 decisions; violations flag manufactured consent.
4. **Versioned timing**: if timing is content, publish side-by-side evaluations for s\@t options with Φ̂ intervals and reasons.

**One-line rule.** Timing matters **only** when it changes the world; if it merely changes the pressure on agents, it is manipulation and does not alter admissibility.

## 3.7 Relation to MECP and TST’s role in pruning contradiction-bearing timelines

**What MECP is.**
**MECP (the law)**: *Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.* It is a timeless constitutional principle fixing the quantifier as U (“all”), the acceptance semantics Aᵢ(s), and the minority-protective veto (any Aᵢ(s)=0 blocks admissibility). MECP is not an estimator or a voting rule; it is the standard that defines admissibility.

**What TST adds.**
**TST (the kernel)** supplies the constructive machinery that makes MECP executable without diluting the law:

* a scalar **Φ(s) ∈ \[0,1]** with unanimity correspondence (Φ=1 ⇔ ∀i, Aᵢ=1),
* a threshold **Θ** and the **δ-gate** (**δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s) ≥ Θ**),
* the **load link** (**Φ=1 ⇔ L=0**) that detects contradiction as ongoing upkeep,
* conservative composition rules (paths, conjunction, disjunction),
* and scale-aware **group floors** that add non-negotiable structural constraints.

Together, the Moral Epistemic Completeness Principle (MECP) states *what must be true*; TST specifies *how to select only what is true*.

---

#### A) The pruning operator

For a current state s, let **T(s)** be the feasible successors (§3.1). Define the **TST pruning operator** at threshold Θ:

* **SelectΘ(s) = { t ∈ T(s) : Φ(s → t) ≥ Θ }**
* **PruneΘ(s) = T(s) − SelectΘ(s)**

At the universal law setting (**Θ=1**):

* **Select₁(s) = { t : Φ(s → t)=1 } = { t : ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s → t)=1 }**
* **Prune₁(s) = { t : ∃i, Aᵢ(s → t)=0 }**

**Path extension.** For a path π = (s₀ → … → sₖ), admissibility is conservative: **Φ(π)=minℓ Φ(sℓ)**; thus pruning is **prefix-closed**—an unacceptable step anywhere prunes the whole path at Θ=1.

**Properties (Θ fixed).**

* **Monotone in Φ.** If Φ(t) ≥ Φ(u) then t ∈ SelectΘ(s) whenever u ∈ SelectΘ(s).
* **Idempotent.** Applying pruning twice does nothing more: **SelectΘ(SelectΘ(s))=SelectΘ(s)** when read as set-filtering on successors.
* **Frame-invariant.** Materially equivalent descriptions yield the same SelectΘ.
* **Floor-safe.** With floors Gᵍ, selection uses \**Φ*(s)=min(Φ(s), minᵍ Gᵍ(s))\*\*; any violated floor prunes.

---

#### B) MECP vs Protocols; where “epistemic completeness” lives

* **Law (MECP).** The admissible set is exactly { s : ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 }. No scope slicing. MECP is not a voting rule, survey, or estimator.
* **Protocol (epistemic completeness).** Finite agents cannot survey U. Protocols therefore estimate **Φ̂(s)** with intervals **[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**, run **step-down tests** on L(s), demand **reversibility** when Θ<1, and log decisions in **receipts** (§3.3, §5–§6). Epistemic completeness is a *discipline* for estimating Φ; it never relaxes the law.

Result: MECP fixes the destination; TST gives the steering and brakes; protocols provide the instruments.

---

#### C) Pruning contradiction-bearing timelines (how selection happens)

**Immediate effect (Θ=1).** If any successor entails a valid veto (∃i with Aᵢ=0), it is pruned: **t ∈ Prune₁(s)**. Only zero-load branches remain in **Select₁(s)**; actualization (δ=1) never licenses contradiction-bearing moves.

**Provisional effect (Θ<1).** When uncertainty forces **Θ<1**, δ may temporarily admit **Φ<1** states, but they carry **L>0**. TST then obliges:

* guaranteed **reversibility**,
* **monitoring** Φ̂ and load indicators,
* **exit triggers** when Φₗ falls or L̂ rises,
  all aimed at reshaping s (compensation, opt-in) so that Φ→1 and pruning converges to the Θ=1 regime.

**Multi-scale effect.**

* **Agentless (DNA).** Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min{r, q, a, i, e}; any failing layer prunes the variant.
* **Group floors.** If any Gᵍ(s)=0 (e.g., grid instability), the branch is pruned irrespective of individual assents.
* **Social/AI.** Packaging tricks (lotteries, staging, framing) cannot avoid pruning: composition axioms take the minimum across steps/branches (§3.1–§3.2).

---

#### D) Why pruning is not utilitarian balancing

TST does **not** trade one agent’s dissent against others’ gains. A single valid veto (Aᵢ=0) prunes; there is no summation over persons. The scalar Φ is **conservative**, not an average: Φ=1 only at unanimity; otherwise Φ<1, signaling contradiction and positive load.

---

#### E) Stability picture in one diagram (verbal)

* Universe of feasible branches from s: **T(s)**
* Apply **floors** → remove structurally impossible or unsafe branches
* Compute **Φ** (conservative, frame-invariant) on remaining branches
* **Select₁(s)** keeps only **Φ=1** (zero-load) branches
* **Prune₁(s)** discards the rest (contradiction-bearing, load-requiring)
* Actualize with **δ=1** only from **Select₁(s)**

Over time, repeating this filter at each step yields a **timeline** composed solely of universally acceptable states.

---

#### F) Micro-example (composed proposal)

Proposal bundle: s = (policy A) ∧ (deployment B then C).

* If Φ(A)=1, Φ(B)=0.98, Φ(C)=1, then **Φ(s)=min(1, 0.98, 1)=0.98** → **δ(s)=0** at Θ=1 → **pruned**.
* If we redesign B with a guaranteed rollback and compensation so that valid vetoes flip to acceptance, Φ(B)→1; then **Φ(s)=1** and **δ(s)=1**. Pruning drove redesign, not averaging away the veto.

---

**Takeaway.** MECP is the universal law; TST is the selection kernel that enforces it. At Θ=1, TST prunes every contradiction-bearing branch and admits only zero-load, universally acceptable timelines. When reality forces provisional work (Θ<1), TST keeps risk on a leash—reversible, monitored, and aimed back at Φ=1—so the system converges to the law rather than drifting from it.

# 4. Agentless Instantiation: The DNA Veto Stack

## 4.1 Layers and signals: r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v)

**Purpose.** These five agentless layers operationalize the DNA veto stack as clearance signals in \[0,1] for a candidate molecular variant or edit **v**. They are measured (or estimated) on standardized assays and compose **conservatively** via **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v) }**. Any layer pulling below Θ installs a veto; δ(v)=1 only if every layer clears Θ.

---

#### A) r(v) — replication/repair pass (fidelity layer)

* **Meaning.** Probability that v is replicated and repaired without producing integrity alarms or lethal errors. Captures polymerase fidelity, mismatch repair, base/nucleotide excision, double-strand break repair quality.
* **Range.** r(v) ∈ \[0,1]; r(v)=1 means no detectable replication/repair penalty attributable to v.
* **Primary proxies (examples).** Mutation accumulation rate near v; mismatch repair markers; γH2AX or comet assay for breaks; error-corrected sequencing of lineages; replication fork stalling metrics.
* **Dynamics.** r can be time-indexed rₜ(v) under stressors (oxidative, replication stress).
* **Failure modes.** Hypermutator background, repair-pathway knockdowns. These do not “raise” r(v); they **change s** and should surface as group-floor risks (§3.5).
* **Load link.** r(v) below Θ implies chronic corrective effort (repair, checkpoint activation), contributing to L(v)>0.

---

#### B) q(v) — checkpoint clearance (cell-cycle layer)

* **Meaning.** Probability that cell-cycle checkpoints (G₁/S, intra-S, G₂/M, spindle) permit progression with v present. Encodes p53/p21/p16 pathways and DNA-damage signaling.
* **Range.** q(v) ∈ \[0,1]; q(v)=1 means no persistent checkpoint arrest attributable to v.
* **Primary proxies.** Phospho-checkpoint markers; flow cytometry phase distributions with and without v; arrest-release experiments; transcriptional signatures of stress response.
* **Interaction.** r and q frequently couple (repair defects trigger checkpoints). Conservatively, Φ₍DNA₎ uses the min rule; interaction terms can be modeled but cannot raise Φ beyond the worst layer.
* **Adversary resistance.** Disabling p53 artificially is not a legitimate Φ increase; it simply hides a veto and will reappear as floor violations (organismal integrity, immune layer).

---

#### C) a(v) — non-trigger of apoptosis/senescence (self-termination layer)

* **Meaning.** Probability that v does **not** trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis) or durable growth arrest (senescence).
* **Range.** a(v) ∈ \[0,1]; a(v)=1 means no apoptotic or senescent conversion attributable to v.
* **Primary proxies.** Annexin V/PI assays; caspase activity; TUNEL; SA-β-gal; mitochondrial potential; pro/anti-apoptotic gene expression balances.
* **Notes.** Short, transient pulses (e.g., adaptation) may be tolerated; persistent activation pulls a(v) below Θ.
* **Load link.** Chronic apoptosis/senescence signals entail clearance/remodeling costs in tissues → L(v)>0 if maintained.

---

#### D) i(v) — immune non-clearance (surveillance layer)

* **Meaning.** Probability that host immune surveillance does **not** target v’s consequences for elimination (innate + adaptive).
* **Range.** i(v) ∈ \[0,1]; i(v)=1 means v does not elicit sustained immune targeting under normative conditions.
* **Primary proxies.** Predicted/observed neoepitope burden and presentation; NK sensitivity (MHC downregulation patterns); co-culture cytotoxicity assays; cytokine release and exhaustion markers; in vivo clearance rates where ethically permissible.
* **Edge cases.** Immune-privileged niches and immune evasion tactics are treated as **environmental content** (change in s), not legitimate i(v) elevation by manipulation.
* **Group-floor tie.** Systemic immune failure is a group-floor breach at the organism scale (§3.5), not a path to admissibility.

---

#### E) e(v) — tissue/microenvironment compatibility (ecological layer)

* **Meaning.** Probability that v can coexist with local resource, signaling, and spatial constraints without causing microenvironmental breakdown (oxygen/nutrient demand, paracrine disruption, ECM constraints, niche occupancy).
* **Range.** e(v) ∈ \[0,1]; e(v)=1 means v integrates without destabilizing the local milieu.
* **Primary proxies.** Competitive fitness in organoids/co-culture; hypoxia and nutrient sensors; metabolic flux balance; niche factor dependence; morphogenesis and barrier integrity assays.
* **Context specificity.** e is evaluated per niche; conservative policy takes the **infimum** across relevant contexts unless individualized isolation can be certified (then evaluate per-context with receipts).

---

#### F) Composition and measurement discipline

* **Conservative aggregator.** **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v) }**. No averaging: a single failing layer vetoes.
* **Intervals.** Report **\[ℓᵣ, uᵣ]**, **\[ℓ\_q, u\_q]**, … and the induced **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**; compare Φₗ to Θ for δ-decisions.
* **Temporal stability.** Use windows long enough to detect adaptation; if any layer degrades over time (drift), re-evaluate Φ₍DNA₎ as **minₜ** across the window.
* **Step-down tests.** Remove compensations (e.g., growth factors masking e, checkpoint inhibitors masking q); if Φ rises only with compensations, L(v) is positive when compensations are removed.

---

#### G) Adversary resistance (no manufactured clearance)

* **No coercive boosts.** Artificially suppressing checkpoints/immune detection or flooding niches to mask incompatibility does **not** raise Φ₍DNA₎ legitimately; it changes s and typically violates group floors.
* **Frame invariance.** Equivalent laboratory framings of v (naming, vector labels) cannot change r, q, a, i, e.
* **Reversibility.** If editing v includes a guaranteed, low-cost rollback, the **proposal** is different (v′) and may legitimately raise Φ via higher r/q/a/i/e values.

---

#### H) Typical interpretations of scores

* **Near 1.0.** No detectable penalties across assays; δ(v)=1 at Θ=1 only if every layer is at 1 within measurement resolution.
* **High but <1.** Some residual penalty remains; δ(v)=0 at Θ=1. Provisional Θ<1 usage (if any) requires reversibility, monitoring, and exit triggers (§3.3).
* **Low on any layer.** Immediate veto; investigate whether redesign (e.g., safer edit, targeted expression, isolation) can legitimately raise that layer.

---

**One-line summary.** The five-layer stack supplies a present-tense, agentless realization of the selection logic: **any** failing clearance r/q/a/i/e is a veto, so **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{…}** captures the conservative “all must pass” rule that mirrors **“Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”**

## 4.2 Definition: Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{r, q, a, i, e}; δ(v)=1 iff Φ₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ

**Definition (agentless biological selector).**
For a candidate molecular variant/edit **v**, define five clearance signals in \[0,1]:

* **r(v)** replication/repair pass,
* **q(v)** checkpoint clearance,
* **a(v)** non-trigger of apoptosis/senescence,
* **i(v)** immune non-clearance,
* **e(v)** tissue/microenvironment compatibility.

Aggregate conservatively:

* **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v) }.**
* **δ(v)=1** iff **Φ₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ**; otherwise **δ(v)=0**.

**Universal-law setting.**

* With **Θ=1**, δ admits **only** variants that clear **every** layer: r=q=a=i=e=1 (within measurement resolution).
* With **Θ<1** (provisional work), any δ=1 implies a residual veto somewhere and thus positive load; strict safeguards from §3.3 apply (reversibility, monitoring, exit triggers).

**Uncertainty discipline.**

* Report layer intervals **\[ℓᵣ,uᵣ]…\[ℓₑ,uₑ]**; induce **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** by min on bounds:
  **Φₗ = min{ℓᵣ,ℓ\_q,ℓ\_a,ℓ\_i,ℓₑ}, Φᵤ = min{uᵣ,u\_q,u\_a,u\_i,uₑ}.**
* Compare **Φₗ** to **Θ** for δ; if **Φₗ < Θ**, δ(v)=0 at that Θ.

**Composition (multiple edits/contexts).**

* **Conjunction of edits** v₁ ∧ v₂: **Φ₍DNA₎(v₁∧v₂) = min(Φ₍DNA₎(v₁), Φ₍DNA₎(v₂), H(v₁,v₂))**, with **H** capturing interaction costs (default 1 only when independence is certified).
* **Sequencing** v₁ then v₂: path rule—take the min across steps.
* **Disjunction** (one of): without guaranteed per-cell individualized choice, evaluate by min; with certified individualized assignment/opt-in, max may apply per individual.
* **Contexts (niches/tissues).** To claim organism-wide admissibility, take the infimum across relevant niches: **Φ₍DNA₎^org(v) = inf₍niche₎ Φ₍DNA₎(v|niche)**, unless certified isolation confines v to a single niche.

**Adversary resistance.**

* Disabling guards (e.g., p53 knockout, immune evasion engineering) does **not** legitimately raise Φ₍DNA₎; it changes the proposal and typically violates group floors (§3.5).
* Frame invariance: renaming vectors or reframing assays does not affect r,q,a,i,e.
* Only operations that truly reduce harm/incompatibility (safer edit design, targeted expression, guaranteed rollback) can raise Φ₍DNA₎.

**Load linkage and falsifiability.**

* If any layer < 1 at Θ=1, maintaining v requires corrective processes (repair, arrest, clearance, remodeling) → **L(v)>0**.
* **Falsifier:** a stable lineage showing long-term persistence of **Φ₍DNA₎(v)<1** with intact layers (no knockouts) and **L(v)=0** after step-down of compensations.

**Worked micro-cases.**

* **All-clear:** r=q=a=i=e=1 ⇒ Φ₍DNA₎=1 ⇒ δ=1 at Θ=1.
* **Single-layer veto:** r=1, q=0.97, a=i=e=1 ⇒ Φ₍DNA₎=0.97 ⇒ δ=0 at Θ=1; provisional δ needs rollback + monitoring.
* **Context-specific:** Φ₍DNA₎(brain)=1, Φ₍DNA₎(liver)=0.9 ⇒ organism-wide Φ₍DNA₎^org=0.9 ⇒ δ=0 at Θ=1 unless isolation to brain is certified (then evaluate per-context).

**One-line rule.**
At the DNA scale, **every** veto layer must clear: **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{…}** captures “only what is acceptable to all” as “only what passes all stacked vetoes.”

## 4.3 Group floors at tissue/organism scales; organismal integrity over rogue advantage

**What group floors do here.**
At multicellular scales, stability is governed not only by single-cell clearances r, q, a, i, e, but also by **integrity constraints of tissues and the organism**. We encode these as **group floors** that **add** non-negotiable predicates; they never replace or average away any underlying layer.

**Predicates (illustrative, not exhaustive).** For a variant or edit v realized in a body:

* **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ(v) ∈ {0,1}** — tissue architecture and function remain intact (no barrier loss, no uncontrolled clonal takeover, preserved polarity and morphogenesis).
* **Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ(v) ∈ {0,1}** — local resource budgets (oxygen, nutrients, space) are not driven past carrying capacity, no paracrine hijack that destabilizes neighbors.
* **Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ(v) ∈ {0,1}** — the immune system remains competent; no systemic disabling, exhaustion, or chronic misdirection.
* **Gᵒʳᵍ(v) ∈ {0,1}** — organismal viability and homeostasis are preserved (no cachexia-like drain, no systemic toxicity, no developmental program breach).

**Conservative aggregation with Φ₍DNA₎.**
Extend the selector by a floor-aware field:

* **Φ*₍DNA₎(v) = min( Φ₍DNA₎(v), Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ(v), Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ(v), Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ(v), Gᵒʳᵍ(v) ).*\*
* **δ(v)=1** iff **Φ*₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ*\*.

**Rogue advantage is not admissibility.**
A variant can raise **cell-local fitness** (appearing to “pass” r or a in isolation) while **violating group floors**:

* **Oncogenic drivers.** A clone that proliferates faster may keep r≈1 and a≈1 in vitro, yet **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ(v)=0** (architecture breach) and **Gᵒʳᵍ(v)=0** (organismal drain). Result: **Φ*₍DNA₎(v)<Θ ⇒ δ=0*\* at Θ=1.
* **Immune evasion.** Engineering to avoid detection might appear to raise i(v), but if it entails systemic checkpoint suppression or chronic exhaustion, **Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ(v)=0**; this is not a legitimate Φ increase—it's a floor violation.
* **Resource hijack.** Variants that force angiogenesis or niche monopolization can set **Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ(v)=0** even when r,q,a,i look high in a buffered niche.

**Composition at higher scales (mirrors §3.1–§3.2).**

* **Conjunction (multiple edits or co-occuring variants).**
  **Gᵍ(v₁ ∧ v₂) = min( Gᵍ(v₁), Gᵍ(v₂), Hᵍ(v₁,v₂) )**, where **Hᵍ** captures interaction stress on the same floor (default to 1 only when independence is certified).
* **Sequencing.** Any intermediate that sets a floor to 0 makes the whole path inadmissible unless a guaranteed rollback restores **Gᵍ=1**.
* **Disjunction.** Without certified **per-cell** assignment, evaluate floors by min; with verified isolation/opt-in, evaluate each branch per the compartment it actually occupies.

**Isolation as a legitimate redesign.**
If a proposal certifies **strict localization** (e.g., confinement to an immune-privileged compartment or an ex vivo bioreactor) and audits that no floor outside the compartment is engaged, evaluate **Φ*₍DNA₎*\* on that compartment alone and log the isolation guarantees in receipts. Isolation changes **s**; it does not “raise” floors by fiat.

**Load linkage (present-tense).**
Any floor violation entails chronic compensations—surveillance, resections, immunotherapies, metabolic support—so **L(v)>0** under step-down of compensations. Thus floors align with the contradiction→load picture: **Gᵍ(v)=0 ⇒ positive upkeep** to hold v in place.

**Measurement discipline (practical signals).**

* **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ:** organoid barrier assays, polarity markers, clonal mosaic competition, morphogenesis integrity.
* **Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ:** hypoxia sensors, flux balance, crowding/ECM stress, carrying-capacity curves.
* **Gᶦᵐᵐᵘᵉˢʸˢ:** co-culture cytotoxicity, cytokine exhaustion profiles, in vivo clearance (where ethical), off-target autoimmunity checks.
* **Gᵒʳᵍ:** systemic biomarkers (cachexia, organ function panels), developmental program checks in relevant models.
  Run **step-down tests**: withdraw growth factors, checkpoint inhibitors, or niche scaffolds; if integrity collapses, **Φ*₍DNA₎*\* was being propped up and **L>0** exists.

**Adversary resistance.**
Disabling p53, globally suppressing immunity, or flooding resources to mask incompatibility **does not** elevate Φ\*₍DNA₎; it changes the proposal and typically sets other floors to 0. Floor predicates are defined on **material invariants**, not lab framings.

**Falsifiers (what would count against this section).**

* A reproducible case where a variant with **Φ₍DNA₎ high but some Gᵍ=0** exhibits **L=0** after step-down of compensations (i.e., a stable, zero-load breach of a bona fide floor).
* Or, sustained organismal health with multiple acknowledged floor violations and no compensatory load.

**One-line summary.**
At multicellular scales, **organismal integrity dominates rogue cell advantage**: admissibility at Θ=1 requires **every** single-cell layer to clear **and** every relevant tissue/organism floor to remain intact—otherwise the variant is pruned.

## 4.4 Predictions and falsifiers (stacked-veto necessity, conservation fixed-points, context-mix pruning)

**Overview.** If the DNA veto stack instantiates the selection logic, then (i) disabling any layer raises transient acceptance of otherwise-pruned variants but degrades system stability; (ii) deeply conserved sequences are fixed points where most nearby variants sit below Θ; and (iii) variants acceptable in one niche but not another are pruned when contexts mix—unless strict isolation is guaranteed. Each prediction comes with a concrete assay and a falsifier.

---

#### A) Stacked-veto necessity

**Prediction A1 (single-layer loss ⇒ transient tolerance + fitness penalty).**
Knock down **one** veto (e.g., mismatch repair → r↓ or p53 checkpoint → q↓). Variants with Φ₍DNA₎ just below Θ will pass locally (δ=1 at lowered Θ), but lineage/tissue fitness degrades (L>0 signatures: chronic repair, arrests, immune activation).

**Assay.** Isogenic cell lines with (i) intact layers, (ii) r– (MMR loss) or q– (p53/p21 loss). Introduce barcoded variant libraries near essential elements; track lineage frequencies, arrest/apoptosis markers, and immune co-culture clearance.

**Metrics.** Δfixation of low-Φ variants vs intact control; growth/viability penalties; load proxies {repair markers, arrest fraction, immune killing}.

**Falsifier.** No enrichment of low-Φ variants and no load increase after single-layer loss compared to intact controls.

---

**Prediction A2 (multi-layer loss ⇒ collapse threshold).**
Joint impairment (e.g., r– ∧ q– or q– ∧ i–) admits many low-Φ variants; tissues/organisms cross a viability threshold (Φ\*₍DNA₎ falls), showing runaway load or collapse.

**Assay.** Combinatorial CRISPR perturbations of r/q/a/i in organoids; titrate layer impairments; measure barrier integrity, morphogenesis, and survival across a grid.

**Metrics.** Critical surface where viability/architecture fails; monotone relation: as **min{r,q,a,i,e}** drops, failures rise.

**Falsifier.** Sustained, healthy organoids/organisms with multiple veto layers disabled, no compensations, and **L≈0** (step-down test passes).

---

**Prediction A3 (rescue by legitimate redesign, not by masking).**
Raising Φ₍DNA₎ via safer edit design or guaranteed rollback restores stability; masking vetoes (e.g., p53 knockout, global checkpoint inhibitors) does **not**—it just shifts to floor violations (Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ/Gᵒʳᵍ=0).

**Assay.** Compare (i) safer promoter/edit (content change) vs (ii) same risky edit under checkpoint/immune suppression (masking). Run step-down tests (withdraw suppressors).

**Metrics.** Only (i) maintains performance with **L→0** after step-down; (ii) reverts or shows positive load.

**Falsifier.** Masking strategies that, after full step-down, keep **L=0** with intact floors.

---

#### B) Conservation fixed-points

**Prediction B1 (DMS cliffs on ultra-conserved elements).**
Deep mutational scanning around ultra-conserved bases/proteins yields a landscape where most variants have **Φ₍DNA₎<Θ** (steep fitness/clearance cliffs); few neutral plateaus.

**Assay.** Saturation mutagenesis libraries in essential motifs; measure r, q, a, i, e proxies; compute Φ₍DNA₎ by min; validate with lineage persistence.

**Metrics.** Heavy left-skew of Φ₍DNA₎; correlation between Φ₍DNA₎ and persistence; near-zero fraction at Φ=1 outside the reference sequence.

**Falsifier.** Broad neutrality: many substitutions with **Φ₍DNA₎≈1** and long-term persistence **with L≈0** contradict the “fixed-point” view.

---

**Prediction B2 (context-robust conservation).**
Variants near fixed points remain low-Φ across diverse contexts; changing media/stressors does not “average out” vetoes (Φ₍DNA₎ uses min over contexts).

**Assay.** Repeat DMS across stressors/niches; take **inf₍context₎ Φ₍DNA₎**.

**Metrics.** Minimal rise in **inf Φ** across contexts; variants acceptable somewhere but vetoed elsewhere remain low on the infimum.

**Falsifier.** Variants that are low-Φ in one context but, after context averaging without isolation, achieve **Φ≈1** and stable persistence **L≈0**.

---

#### C) Context-mix pruning

**Prediction C1 (mixing niches prunes cross-incompatible variants).**
If v is acceptable in niche A (Φ₍DNA₎^A≈1) but not B (Φ₍DNA₎^B<Θ), then in co-culture/mosaic tissues A∪B, v loses share or triggers floor violations; **Φ₍DNA₎^org = inf{Φ^A, Φ^B} < Θ ⇒ pruning**.

**Assay.** Barcoded lines engineered so v is niche-A optimized; co-culture with niche-B cells; track frequencies, floor markers (barrier integrity), and load proxies.

**Metrics.** Selective decline of v in mixed culture or rise in L and Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ=0 if it persists.

**Falsifier.** Stable or rising share of v in mixed contexts with **L≈0** and floors intact.

---

**Prediction C2 (certified isolation reverses pruning).**
If strict isolation confines v to niche A (no engagement with B), evaluate Φ only in A; pruning pressure disappears.

**Assay.** Physical/temporal confinement with audited leakage bounds; repeat C1.

**Metrics.** Persistence of v with **Φ₍DNA₎^A=1**, **L→0** after step-down of isolation supports legitimate admissibility.

**Falsifier.** Persistence claims that rely on isolation but fail leakage audits or show hidden load after step-down.

---

#### D) Load signatures (present-tense measurables)

**Prediction D1 (Φ↘ ⇒ L↗).**
Across edits and contexts, lower Φ₍DNA₎ predicts higher measured load components: repair signaling (r-linked), checkpoint arrest (q-linked), apoptotic/senescent fractions (a-linked), immune cytotoxicity (i-linked), microenvironmental stress (e-linked).

**Assay.** Panel of edits spanning Φ; quantify {Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ} proxies; run **step-down** (remove compensations).

**Metrics.** Monotone negative correlation between Φ and load; **L→0** only at **Φ=1**.

**Falsifier.** Repeated cases with **Φ<1** yet **L=0** after step-down and intact floors.

---

#### E) Threshold and composition behavior

**Prediction E1 (Θ-sweep phase diagram).**
As Θ increases to 1, the admissible set contracts; at **Θ=1** only all-clear variants remain. Conjunction/sequencing lowers admissibility by the min rule; disjunction gains admissibility **only** with certified individualized assignment.

**Assay.** Compute Φ for single vs composite edits; sweep Θ; log δ decisions with receipts.

**Metrics.** Set-inclusion: SelectΘ₂ ⊆ SelectΘ₁ for Θ₂>Θ₁; Φ(conjunction) = min; Φ(path)=min over steps.

**Falsifier.** Any observed increase in admissibility when adding content (violates monotonicity), or lotteries increasing Φ without individualized guarantees.

---

#### F) Invalid “rescues” (adversary resistance)

**Prediction F1.** Disabling checkpoints/immune surveillance or flooding niches to mask incompatibility does not legitimately raise Φ\*₍DNA₎; after removing the mask, Φ and outcomes revert and **L>0** appears.

**Assay.** Compare masked vs redesigned edits; perform step-down; check floors.

**Falsifier.** Masking that survives step-down with **L=0** and intact floors.

---

**Summary falsifier for the section.**
Any reproducible demonstration of (i) **Φ₍DNA₎<1 with L=0** after full step-down and intact floors, (ii) **broad neutrality** around ultra-conserved cores (high Φ for many substitutions with L=0), or (iii) **no pruning** of cross-incompatible variants in mixed contexts, would undermine the DNA-level instantiation of the theorem.

## 4.5 Minimal simulations: Θ-sweeps and phase diagrams

**Purpose.** Give a small, reproducible sandbox that illustrates the selector’s behavior: how admissibility shrinks as Θ→1, how conjunction/sequence uses the min rule, how floors and context-mix lower admissibility, and how provisional Θ<1 must be paired with reversibility.

---

#### A) Core single-edit sweep

**Setup.**

* Draw layer clearances r, q, a, i, e ∈ \[0,1] for N variants v₁…v\_N. Start with independent Beta priors (e.g., Beta(α, β)) and then add correlated cases (coupling r↔q) to test robustness.
* Compute Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r, q, a, i, e }.
* Sweep Θ over a grid Θ ∈ {0.50, 0.60, …, 1.00}. For each Θ, set δ(v)=1 iff Φ₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ.

**Outputs.**

* Phase curve: admissible fraction vs Θ. Expect monotone contraction toward zero as Θ→1 unless some variants sit at all-clear.
* Histogram panels of Φ₍DNA₎ showing the left-skew from the min aggregator.

**Checks.**

* Monotonicity: SelectΘ₂ ⊆ SelectΘ₁ for Θ₂>Θ₁.
* Sensitivity: tighten priors (heavier tails near 1) and confirm identical qualitative behavior.

---

#### B) Composition experiments (conjunction, sequence, disjunction)

**Conjunction.**

* Sample two independent edits v, w with Φ₍DNA₎ values.
* Define composite c = v ∧ w with Φ₍DNA₎(c) = min(Φ₍DNA₎(v), Φ₍DNA₎(w), H(v, w)).
* Interaction H ∈ \[0,1]: set H=1 under certified independence; otherwise draw H from a stress prior (e.g., Beta(2, 8)).
* Sweep Θ; plot admissible fraction for singles vs conjunctions. Expect conjunction curve to lie below singles.

**Sequence (paths).**

* Generate 2–4 step paths π with step Φ’s drawn as above; set Φ(π) = min over steps.
* Θ-sweep; show that any low step controls the whole path.

**Disjunction.**

* Without individualized choice: Φ(v ∨ w) = min(Φ(v), Φ(w)).
* With certified individualized choice: Φ(v ∨ w) = max(Φ(v), Φ(w)).
* Plot both regimes; show that only the certified regime can improve admissibility.

---

#### C) Context-mix and isolation

**Multicontext Φ.**

* For each variant, draw context-specific layer sets for K niches, compute Φ₍DNA₎^k, then take organism-level Φ₍DNA₎^org = min\_k Φ₍DNA₎^k.
* Θ-sweep; compare:

  1. pooled organism case (min across contexts),
  2. certified isolation case (evaluate under a single niche with leakage bound ε; if ε>0, include a penalty term so Φ₍DNA₎^iso = min(Φ₍DNA₎^A, 1−ε)).

**Expectation.**

* Pooled case admits fewer variants; isolation increases admissibility only when leakage is near zero and certified.

---

#### D) Group floors

**Floor definition.**

* Sample floor predicates Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ, Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ, Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ, Gᵒʳᵍ ∈ {0,1} via stress models tied to layers (e.g., Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ=0 with probability increasing when a or e are low).
* Define Φ\*₍DNA₎ = min(Φ₍DNA₎, floors).

**Sweep.**

* Plot admissible fraction using Φ\*₍DNA₎ under Θ, with and without floors. Expect floors to strictly reduce admissibility and to dominate when low-layer penalties cluster.

---

#### E) Uncertainty and receipts

**Intervals.**

* For each layer, attach a confidence band \[ℓ, u]; derive \[Φₗ, Φᵤ] by min on bounds.
* Decision uses Φₗ against Θ. Count:

  * safe admits (Φₗ ≥ Θ),
  * abstentions (Φₗ < Θ ≤ Φᵤ),
  * safe rejects (Φᵤ < Θ).

**Deliverables.**

* A table per Θ with these counts plus audit fields needed by receipts (source models, interaction flags, isolation flags).

---

#### F) Provisional regime safety (Θ<1)

**Reversibility.**

* For each δ=1 with Φ<1, attach a rollback path πʳ with cost cᵣ and feasibility pᵣ. Require cᵣ ≤ c\* and pᵣ ≥ p\* as declared safeguards.
* Simulate monitoring drift by degrading one layer over time; trigger exit when Φₗ drops below Θ or when floor predicates flip to 0.

**Expectation.**

* Runs that satisfy safeguards revert safely upon drift; those that lack safeguards accumulate positive load flags (proxy counters tied to the failing layer).

---

#### G) Minimal pseudo-code (language-agnostic, Unicode symbols)

```
input: N, K, Θ_grid, priors for r,q,a,i,e, floor models, isolation ε
for n in 1..N:
  draw layers r,q,a,i,e ~ priors
  Φ = min(r,q,a,i,e)
  for k in 1..K:
    draw r_k,q_k,a_k,i_k,e_k ~ context_priors
    Φ_k = min(r_k,q_k,a_k,i_k,e_k)
  Φ_org = min_k Φ_k
  floors = {G_tissue, G_resource, G_immune, G_org} from floor_models(Φ or layers)
  Φ_star = min(Φ_org, floors)
  compute intervals [Φₗ, Φᵤ] from layer bands
  for Θ in Θ_grid:
    δ_universal = 1 if Φ_star ≥ Θ else 0
    δ_conj_seq_disj = per §4.2–§3.2 rules
    classify as admit/abstain/reject using Φₗ vs Θ
aggregate: admissible fractions, phase curves, composition gaps, isolation gains, abstention rates
```

---

#### H) Plots to include (single page each)

1. **Admissible fraction vs Θ** for singles, conjunctions, sequences, and disjunctions (both regimes).
2. **Context panel:** pooled vs certified isolation across Θ.
3. **Floors on/off:** two curves showing the contraction from floors.
4. **Uncertainty bars:** stacked bars for admit/abstain/reject at representative Θ values.

---

#### I) What would falsify the selector’s behavior in simulation

* An increase in admissibility when adding content (violates monotonicity).
* Lotteries raising Φ without individualized guarantees.
* Context averaging that lifts pooled Φ above the worst context without certified isolation.
* Floors increasing admissibility.

Any of these indicates a coding error or a metric that violates the axioms in §3.2–§3.3.

---

**One-line summary.** The Θ-sweep sandbox shows, with minimal assumptions, that conservative min-composition plus floors yields the expected phase structure: admissibility contracts to exactly the all-clear set as Θ→1, and any packaging trick that would “launder” a veto fails unless the proposal itself is legitimately redesigned.

## 4.6 What this instantiation shows (plausibility), and what it does not (no genomic moralism)

**What it shows (present-tense plausibility).**

* **Structural homology.** The stacked veto logic at the DNA scale—r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v) with **Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min{…}**—has the same **“all must clear”** form as the law “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”
* **Selection without agents.** δ(v)=1 iff **Φ₍DNA₎(v) ≥ Θ** demonstrates pruning of contradiction-bearing trajectories **without** deliberating minds; the logic is not contingent on human conventions.
* **Load linkage.** Any failing layer creates ongoing corrective processes (repair, arrest, clearance, remodeling), i.e., **L(v)>0** under step-down, mirroring §2’s contradiction→load result.
* **Scale continuity via floors.** Tissue/organism floors **Gᵍ(v)** extend the same conservative composition used at the agent level (§3.5), showing how local advantage is overruled by higher-level integrity.

**What it does *not* show (explicit limits).**

* **No “genomic moralism.”** We do **not** claim DNA “contains morals” or that biological success = moral rightness. The mapping is **structural** (form of selection), not **normative content**.
* **No naturalistic leap.** The law (MECP) is normative; Φ₍DNA₎ is an **is-type** instantiation of the *selector form*. We do not derive “ought” from “is”; we display a present-tense *model* where the same veto structure already operates.
* **No license for eugenic or coercive inference.** Organismal viability or prevalence does not justify human policy. Human δ-decisions remain governed by **universal assent over U**, not by what biology “tends to do.”
* **No claim of uniqueness of layers.** r, q, a, i, e are a **useful basis**, not a metaphysical canon. Other legitimate biological layers can be added as floors; the min-composition remains.
* **No promise of easy measurement.** Assays are proxies with uncertainty; Φ₍DNA₎ must be reported with intervals **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** and audited per §3.3, §4.2.

**Scope boundaries (how to read results).**

* **Agentless domain only.** Φ₍DNA₎ applies where consent semantics (Aᵢ) are inapplicable. Once agents appear, **Aᵢ(s)** and group floors govern; Φ₍DNA₎ can inform, not override.
* **Context specificity.** Organism-level admissibility uses **inf₍niche₎ Φ₍DNA₎** unless strict isolation is certified; averaging across contexts is disallowed.
* **Model humility.** If experiments falsify §4.4 predictions, we revise Φ₍DNA₎’s layer set or its use—not the law itself.

**How to use this section in the paper.**

* **Illustration, not proof.** Cite §2–§3 as the proof of the law. Use §4 to **illustrate** that nature already runs a selector with the same conservative shape.
* **Heuristic for tests.** Let Φ₍DNA₎ guide falsifiable predictions and step-down assays; treat successes as **corroboration of plausibility**, not as normative endorsement.

**Misuse warnings (anti-abuse).**

* **Prevalence fallacy.** “Common in biology” ≠ “admissible for humans.”
* **Masking fallacy.** Raising Φ₍DNA₎ by disabling checkpoints/immune surveillance is illegitimate; it changes the proposal and trips floors (see §4.3).
* **Aggregation fallacy.** No averaging away a failing layer; **min** is conservative by design.

**Falsification vs support (reading outcomes).**

* **Support:** Observing stacked-veto necessity, conservation fixed-points, and context-mix pruning with **L→0 only at Φ₍DNA₎=1** supports the selector’s plausibility.
* **Refutation of this instantiation:** Stable, zero-load persistence of **Φ₍DNA₎<1** variants with intact layers after step-down, or broad neutrality in ultra-conserved cores, would undermine §4, prompting a remap of layers or rejection of the DNA instantiation.

**One-line takeaway.** The DNA veto stack is **evidence of form, not of moral content**: it shows that nature already enforces an “all-must-clear” selector, corroborating the plausibility of our law’s structure while leaving the law’s **normative force** anchored where it belongs—**in universal assent, not in genomes**.

# 5. Law vs Protocol (Separation Principle)

## 5.1 The law is unanimity over U; protocols are estimators of Φ

**Separation principle.**

* **Law (MECP).** Admissible ⇔ **∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1**. No carve-outs, no weighting, no averaging.
* **Protocol.** Because finite agents cannot survey U directly, protocols produce **estimates** of acceptability and enforce conservative decision rules. Protocols never change the law’s quantifier or semantics; they only manage uncertainty about **Φ(s)**.

**Estimator surface.**

* Let **Φ̂(s)** be a protocol’s estimate with a calibrated interval **\[Φₗ(s), Φᵤ(s)]** such that Φₗ ≤ Φ ≤ Φᵤ.
* Evidence enters through audited sources (deliberation outcomes, compensation offers, opt-in guarantees, reversibility proofs, floor tests).
* Estimators must be **frame-invariant** and **adversary-resistant** (see §3.2 A1–A3).

**Protocol compact (non-negotiables).**

1. **No scope slicing.** Protocols may not redefine “all” to “affected,” “present,” or any subset.
2. **Conservatism.** Aggregate evidence with **min** (or a declared, more conservative t-norm) across components, contexts, and path steps; never average away a valid veto.
3. **Abstention default.** If **Φₗ(s) < Θ**, do not set **δ(s)=1**. When action is necessary, restrict to **reversible**, **opt-in** pilots that legitimately modify s.
4. **Reversibility.** Any δ(s)=1 with **Φ̂(s)<1** must publish a guaranteed, low-cost rollback path πʳ and exit triggers (see §3.3C).
5. **Manipulation firewall.** Coercion, misinformation, or choice-architecture tricks cannot raise Φ̂; they are logged as load-shifting, not acceptability.
6. **Receipts.** Every δ-decision issues a signed receipt (proposal hash, Θ, Φ̂ with \[Φₗ,Φᵤ], aggregation rule, floors checked, reversibility plan, monitoring metrics).
7. **Red-team & step-down.** Regularly reframe s to test invariance and run **step-down tests** to probe hidden load (L̂); adjust Φ̂ accordingly.

**Decision rules (by regime).**

* **Universal regime (Θ=1).**

  * **Admit:** only if **Φₗ(s)=1** (within resolution) and all applicable floors Gᵍ(s)=1.
  * **Abstain/Redesign:** if Φₗ<1. Redesign s (compensation, opt-in, guaranteed rollback) to convert valid vetoes Aᵢ=0 → 1.
* **Provisional regime (Θ<1, time-boxed).**

  * **Admit:** only with published **Provisional Use Warrant** (scope, duration, rollback πʳ, monitoring, exit triggers) and continuous Φ̂-tracking.
  * **Exit:** auto-revoke δ(s)=1 if **Φₗ<Θ**, rollback feasibility drops, or load indicators exceed caps.

**What protocols may estimate (but not redefine).**

* **Standing of vetoes.** Evidence that some claimed veto is misinformed/coerced/manufactured ⇒ it is **not** a valid Aᵢ=0.
* **Transformation mechanisms.** Evidence that compensation, opt-in isolation, or guaranteed reversibility changes the **content** of s so that some Aᵢ flip to 1.
* **Floors.** Tests that Gᵍ(s)=1 (or 0); floors compose by **min** with Φ (see §3.5).

**Minimal estimator requirements (E-series).**

* **E1 Calibration.** Report empirical coverage for **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**; miscalibration triggers stricter abstention.
* **E2 Decomposition.** Expose per-component contributions (path steps, contexts, floors) so the **min** can be audited.
* **E3 Invariance.** Demonstrate equal Φ̂ for materially equivalent framings (hash match).
* **E4 Monotonicity.** Adding content cannot raise Φ̂; removing content cannot lower it.
* **E5 Non-manufacture tests.** Show that removing coercive/opaque elements does not reduce Φ̂; if it does, prior estimate was invalid.
* **E6 Drift alarms.** Online checks for preference or environment drift; trigger review or exit.
* **E7 Receipts & reproducibility.** Every estimate is reproducible from logged inputs and rules.

**Burden of proof.**

* **To admit:** show **Φₗ ≥ Θ** (and floors intact).
* **To punish:** require a designated, higher consensus bar (policy choice in §5.4) distinct from Θ.
* **To continue provisional use:** show that monitoring holds Φₗ ≥ Θ and rollback remains feasible.

**Bottom line.** The law is **unanimity over U**. Protocols never modify that target; they **estimate Φ** conservatively, enforce abstention or reversibility under uncertainty, and provide auditable receipts so δ-decisions remain faithful to the law.

## 5.2 Conservative defaults: abstention, reversibility, sandboxing

**Prime directive.** When in doubt, **don’t lock in**. Protocols must default to:

1. **Abstention** when Φₗ(s) < Θ.
2. **Reversibility** when any action proceeds with Φ̂(s) < 1.
3. **Sandboxing** (opt-in, bounded trials) to learn safely and legitimately raise Φ by changing s.

---

#### A) Abstention (the safe default)

* **Trigger.** Φₗ(s) < Θ or any applicable floor Gᵍ(s) is unverified.
* **Action.** Set δ(s)=0. Publish what evidence would raise Φₗ to Θ (missing tests, audits, compensation offers, isolation guarantees).
* **No “must act” loophole.** “Urgency” changes δ only if it encodes real content (verifiable floor risk per §3.6). Otherwise it is framing and does not alter Aᵢ or Φ.

---

#### B) Reversibility (design before deploy)

* **Definition.** A rollback path πʳ that restores the prior state (or a universally acceptable safe state) at **low cost** and **high feasibility**.
* **Requirement when Θ<1 or Φ̂<1.** δ(s)=1 is permitted only if a **certified** πʳ exists and is logged in the receipt.
* **Certification checklist.**

  1. **Feasibility pᵣ ≥ p\*** (declared threshold).
  2. **Cost cᵣ ≤ c\*** (time, resources, disruption).
  3. **Floors safe:** δ(πʳ)=1 at the same Θ; πʳ does not breach floors.
  4. **Latency bound tᵣ:** rollback can complete before damage becomes irrecoverable.
  5. **Operator clarity:** who triggers, with what authority; tested drills.
* **What counts as reversible.** Configuration flags, feature gates, opt-in participation, temporary allocations, soft commitments.
* **What does not.** Irreversible physical harm, non-erasable disclosures, ecological release without capture, commitments that create lock-in dependencies.

---

#### C) Sandboxing (bounded opt-in trials)

* **Goal.** Change the **content** of s (e.g., add compensation, opt-in isolation, guarantees) to flip some Aᵢ from 0 → 1 legitimately and raise Φ.
* **Three levels.**

  * **S1 Dry-run (no impact).** Simulations, shadow modes, red-team exercises. δ=0; collect evidence to raise Φ̂.
  * **S2 Opt-in micro-pilot.** A limited, **explicitly opt-in** cohort with blast-radius caps; full reversibility; isolation from non-participants.
  * **S3 Limited release with hard caps.** Wider but still bounded scope; kill-switch, automatic exit triggers, and continuous Φ̂/L̂ monitoring.
* **Caps.** Set and log maxima on participants N\*, duration T\*, spend R\*, and risk metrics; exceeding any cap auto-reverts via πʳ.
* **Isolation.** No leakage to non-participants; treat isolation as content (raises Φ only if verified).

---

#### D) Provisional Use Warrant (when Θ<1)

Before any δ(s)=1 with Θ<1, publish a warrant containing:

* **Scope.** Domain, population, geography, time window.
* **Θ value** and rationale; target to restore Θ→1.
* **Φ̂ report** with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** and decomposition (paths, contexts, floors).
* **Reversibility plan** πʳ (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ) and operators.
* **Monitoring plan.** Metrics for Φ̂ drift and load L̂ components {Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ}.
* **Exit triggers.** Automatic δ→0 if Φₗ<Θ, floors flip, πʳ infeasible, or caps breached.
* **Receipts.** Material-equivalence hash; audit log destinations.

---

#### E) Monitoring and exit (run-time discipline)

* **Live Φ̂.** Track **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** in real time; widen intervals under drift.
* **Load sentinels.** Proxy counters for enforcement, persuasion, or institutional friction; rising L̂ implies contradiction—review or exit.
* **Step-down tests.** Periodically relax compensations; if the state degrades, L>0 and provisional use must end or be redesigned.

---

#### F) Misuses (hard prohibitions)

* **No averaging away vetoes.** Lotteries, bundling, or staging cannot lift Φ unless individualized choice or guaranteed reversal is certified.
* **No manufactured consent.** Coercion/misinformation cannot raise Φ̂; it only shifts burden into Lᶦⁿᶠ/Lⁱⁿˢ.
* **No irreversible sandboxing.** If πʳ cannot be δ-admissible, sandboxing is disallowed.
* **No silent Θ drift.** All changes to Θ require a new warrant.

---

#### G) Minimal decision algorithm (operator view)

1. Compute Φ̂(s) with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** and check floors Gᵍ.
2. If Φₗ < Θ or any floor unverified → **abstain** (δ=0); publish missing evidence.
3. If Θ<1 by policy → issue **Provisional Use Warrant**.
4. Verify **πʳ** (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ) and sandbox level (S1/S2/S3) with caps.
5. Set δ(s)=1 only if all above pass; start **monitoring** and arm **exit triggers**.
6. Run periodic **step-down**; if Φₗ drops or L̂ rises beyond caps → execute πʳ and set δ=0.

---

#### H) Micro-examples

* **Good:** New recommender feature. S2 opt-in for 1% users, kill-switch, data rollback, clear exit triggers. Compensation: ad-free period. Result: some prior vetoes flip → Φ̂ rises; expand only when Φₗ≥Θ.
* **Bad:** Citywide facial recognition “pilot.” No opt-in, no rollback, hidden datasets, coercive deterrence. Floors (rights, institutional friction) unverified. Φₗ<Θ ⇒ **abstain**.

---

**Bottom line.** Conservative defaults keep δ-decisions faithful to the law: if unanimity isn’t demonstrated, do nothing irrevocable. Learn in sandboxes, design reversibility first, monitor load, and exit automatically at the first sign of contradiction.

## 5.3 Evidence integration: deliberation and compensation to transform Aᵢ from 0 → 1

**Goal.** Provide lawful ways to **change the content of s** (not the people) so that some valid vetoes **Aᵢ(s)=0** become **Aᵢ(s′)=1** under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions—thereby legitimately raising **Φ(s′)**. All moves are auditable and frame-invariant.

---

#### A) What counts as a legitimate transformation

A move is legitimate iff it alters s so that i’s reasons now support acceptance **without** coercion, misinformation, or choice-architecture tricks. Canonical levers:

1. **Disclosure and comprehension.** Supply missing facts; ensure plain-language understanding, Q\&A time, and test-of-understanding receipts.
2. **Deliberation.** Structured exchange where reasons are surfaced and countered; may reveal redesigns that remove the grounds for veto.
3. **Compensation.** Add benefits that address i’s specific cost or risk, including monetary compensation, time, access, or rights protections.
4. **Insurance and guarantees.** Provide enforceable assurances against downside (coverage caps, restitution schedules).
5. **Opt-in and isolation.** Convert s into **sᵒᵖᵗ** where participation is voluntary and effects are **confined** (no leakage onto non-participants).
6. **Reversibility.** Add a tested rollback path πʳ that materially reduces irreversibility risk.
7. **Tailoring and menus.** Offer contract menus so each i can select an acceptable branch; when certified, disjunction evaluates by max (§3.2 M5).

Invalid “transformations” that **do not** change Aᵢ: coercion, nudges that bypass reasons, dark patterns, strategic withholding, fabricated scarcity, “vote now” pressure, or stacking unrelated benefits contingent on assent.

---

#### B) Deliberation protocols (from reasons to redesign)

* **Preconditions.** Equal access to information; translation to plain language; time windows proportional to complexity; representation for those who cannot attend.
* **Format.** Publish agenda, alternatives, and failure modes; collect reasons per agent class; produce a **reasons matrix** mapping objections → proposed redesigns.
* **Output.** A **deliberation receipt** listing: objections addressed, content changes, unresolved vetoes, and which Aᵢ remain 0.
* **Non-manufacture guard.** Facilitation must not bias by framing; parallel red-team sessions test invariance.
* **Effect.** Only if reasons are resolved by changing s (not by browbeating) do relevant Aᵢ flip to 1.

---

#### C) Compensation and insurance without coercion

* **Individual rationality.** A compensation package **comp** is valid for i only if i, informed and uncoerced, prefers s+comp to status quo or an available opt-out.
* **Non-exploitative bandwidth.** Disallow essential-needs leverage (e.g., “accept or lose medication/food/shelter”).
* **Proportionality.** Compensation matches private cost and externality risk.
* **Auditability.** Contract terms, payout triggers, adjudicator identity, and escrow source logged in the δ-receipt.
* **Insurance.** Explicit coverage with limits and adjudication time tₐ; guarantees that survive sponsor failure (escrow, reinsurance).
* **Effect on Aᵢ.** If package neutralizes the reason for rejection, set Aᵢ(s+comp)=1; if it merely distracts or pressures, Aᵢ stays 0.

---

#### D) Opt-in, isolation, and individualized choice

* **Opt-in.** Participation requires an explicit, revocable yes; default is no.
* **Isolation.** Technical and organizational controls ensure non-participants experience **¬s**; leakage bound ε must be published.
* **Menus.** Offer {s¹, s², …, ¬s} such that each i can secure a branch with Aᵢ=1. With certified individualized assignment, Φ(s¹ ∨ s² …) = max over branches per §3.2.
* **Revocation.** Participants can exit along πʳ at bounded cost cᵣ and latency tᵣ.
* **Proof.** Receipts include isolation diagrams, leakage tests, and assignment proofs.

---

#### E) Evidence classes that can raise Φ

1. **Direct assent logs.** Verified acceptances after semantic checks in §2.2.
2. **Redesigned content diffs.** Before/after diffs of s showing how reasons were addressed.
3. **Insurance contracts and escrows.** Third-party attestations and coverage proofs.
4. **Isolation tests.** Leakage audits with measured ε; step-down showing persistence without hidden props.
5. **Rollback drills.** Timed exercises validating πʳ feasibility pᵣ and cost cᵣ.
6. **Load relief.** Step-down tests where L̂ decreases to 0 after redesign (contradiction resolved, not suppressed).
7. **Floor certifications.** Gᵍ(s)=1 evidence from stress tests (§3.5).

All evidence must be **frame-invariant**: materially equivalent descriptions yield identical Φ̂.

---

#### F) Proof obligations and receipts (operator checklist)

A δ-decision that claims transformations Aᵢ:0→1 must publish:

* The **agent classes** for which flips occurred and the specific content changes that caused them.
* The **non-manufacture audit** (who checked for coercion/misinformation/dark patterns).
* Contracts: compensation terms, insurance coverage, arbitrator identity, escrow proofs.
* Opt-in rate, isolation ε, assignment proofs, and πʳ details (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ).
* Updated Φ̂ with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** and a decomposition showing which components moved and why.

---

#### G) Monitoring, drift, and dispute resolution

* **Continuous checks.** Track Φ̂(s) and L̂; if Φₗ drops or L̂ rises, review; if floors flip or πʳ degrades, auto-exit (§3.3).
* **Drift-aware consent.** If conditions change materially, re-consent is required; old assent does not bind to new s′.
* **Disputes.** Provide independent adjudication routes that do not penalize refusal; decisions can set Aᵢ back to 0 and force δ(s)=0 if guarantees fail.

---

#### H) Micro-examples (legitimate vs illegitimate)

* **Legitimate flip.** A city congestion charge s is redesigned with: revenue rebate to residents, wheelchair-access guarantees, opt-in delivery windows, and fee waivers for medical trips; rollback after 90 days. Several prior vetoes become acceptances; Φ̂ rises with L̂→0 under step-down.
* **Illegitimate “flip.”** Same policy but with aggressive countdown ads, buried exemptions, and threats of service loss for non-payers. Apparent assent rises, but non-manufacture fails; Aᵢ remain 0, Φ̂ must not increase, and L̂ spikes.

---

#### I) Minimal formal tie-in

Let **s′ = s ⊕ m**, where m is a bundle of legitimate modifiers (disclosure, comp, insurance, opt-in, isolation, rollback). Then:

* For any i whose objection is addressed by m, **Aᵢ(s′)=1** where previously Aᵢ(s)=0.
* **Φ(s′) ≥ Φ(s)** with equality only if no valid veto is resolved.
* If Φ(s′)=1 and floors Gᵍ(s′)=1, then by §3.4 **L(s′)=0**, and δ(s′)=1 at Θ=1.

**Bottom line.** Evidence integration is about **changing s, not changing minds by force**. Deliberation, compensation, insurance, opt-in isolation, and reversibility are the legitimate tools that convert real objections into real acceptances, raising Φ without violating the law’s semantics.

## 5.4 Punishability vs permission: overwhelming-consensus triggers

**Asymmetry.** Permission is **prospective** and locks in a state; punishment is **retrospective** and restricts liberty. Both answer to the same **law** (unanimity over U), but protocols impose **different proof bars**:

* **Permission:** admit only what is unanimously acceptable.
* **Punishment:** sanction only when there is *overwhelming consensus* that a past act violated the law **and** the actor was culpable.

---

#### A) Two gates, two thresholds

* **Action gate (permission).** With the universal regime, **Θ=1** and **δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s)=1** (Sections §3.3–§3.4). In practice we compare the **lower bound** Φₗ(s) to Θ and abstain if Φₗ<Θ.

* **Sanction gate (punishability).** Define a **condemnation field** **Γ(s) = 1 − Φ(s)** with estimate **Γ̂** and interval **\[Γₗ, Γᵤ]** (equivalently use Φ̂ with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**). Let **Π ∈ (Θ, 1]** be the punishability threshold (policy choice).

  * **Trigger:** *overwhelming consensus* that s was inadmissible means **Γₗ(s) ≥ Π**, equivalently **Φᵤ(s) ≤ 1 − Π**.
  * **Rule:** no punitive sanction unless the trigger holds **and** culpability tests pass (below).

*Why Π > Θ.* Permission with Θ=1 requires unanimity to act; punishment should require stricter evidence than “not proven unanimous,” else uncertainty would criminalize good-faith behavior. Hence **Π** sits near 1 and is **independent of Θ**.

---

#### B) Culpability conditions (beyond wrongness)

Even if *s* was inadmissible, punishment requires that the actor:

1. **Knew or should have known** (information condition): the unlawfulness was reasonably knowable under §2.2 semantics.
2. **Had admissible alternatives** (feasibility condition): there existed t with **δ(t)=1** at the prevailing Θ and within the actor’s reasonable capabilities.
3. **Acted without coercion** (voluntariness condition): no external threat forcing s.
4. **Did not rely on protocol failures** (fair-notice condition): if institutions themselves mis-signaled δ(s)=1 (official clearance) and the actor relied in good faith, punitive blame is reduced or null; restorative routes apply.

Punishment is **impermissible** if any condition fails; use non-punitive remedies (restoration, redesign, education) instead.

---

#### C) Severity calibration and reversibility

* **Penalty ∝ certainty and harm.** Harsher sanctions demand **higher Π** and stronger Γ-evidence, plus stronger proof of culpability.
* **Reversibility of sanctions.** Prefer sanctions that can be **rolled back** if Φ̂/Γ̂ updates (appeals). Irreversible penalties require the maximal Π and due-process layers.

---

#### D) Evidence bundle for the punishability trigger

A sanctioning decision must publish a receipt (cf. §3.3D) showing:

* **Π** in force and rationale.
* **Γ̂(s)** with **\[Γₗ, Γᵤ]** (or **Φ̂** with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**), decomposition by components/contexts/floors, and proof of frame invariance.
* **Culpability proofs:** notice given, alternatives available (list t with δ(t)=1), coercion audit, and reliance-on-protocol analysis.
* **Proportionality analysis** and any **reversal/appeal** mechanism.

---

#### E) Non-complements: why “not permission” ≠ “punishable”

* **Permission test (Θ=1):** if **Φₗ(s) < 1**, we **abstain** from authorizing s.
* **Punishability test (Π):** we punish only if **Γₗ(s) ≥ Π** *and* culpability holds.
  Between these bars lies a **gray zone**: acts not authorized ex ante but not punishable ex post (e.g., ambiguity, institutional error, honest mistake). In that zone, use **restorative** tools, not punishment.

---

#### F) AI vs humans (role separation)

* **AI systems:** must **not punish**. They (i) refuse to act without unanimity (Θ=1), (ii) log evidence, (iii) escalate to legitimate human processes.
* **Human institutions:** may punish **only** under the Π trigger + culpability + due process; publish sanction receipts and allow appeals.

---

#### G) Micro-examples

1. **Not permitted, not punishable.** A city department deploys a feature without unanimity evidence (Φₗ<1). After complaints, Γ̂ is broad **but** Γₗ<Π. Result: rollback (reversibility), compensation to affected, **no** punitive sanction.

2. **Punishable.** A vendor ships a biometric system with known harms; prior rulings and broad deliberation set **Γₗ≥Π**, and alternatives existed (manual verification). No coercion, clear notice. Result: sanctions; receipt logs Π, Γ̂, alternatives, and due process.

3. **Institutional fault.** A lab followed an official δ=1 clearance later found invalid (protocol failure). Γ̂ may be high, but **fair-notice** fails ⇒ restorative remedies, not punishment.

---

#### H) Compact formal summary

* **Permission:** at universal law, **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1**; in practice require **Φₗ(s)=1**.
* **Punishability:** sanction only if **Γₗ(s) ≥ Π** (≡ **Φᵤ(s) ≤ 1−Π**) **and** {knowledge, alternatives, voluntariness, fair-notice} hold.
* **Defaults:** uncertainty ⇒ **no lock-in, no punishment**; use reversible, restorative paths.

**Bottom line.** Punishment is not the mirror of permission. It is rarer, requires **overwhelming consensus** of wrongness plus culpability, and must remain reversible where possible. This preserves freedom under uncertainty while staying faithful to the law of unanimity over **U**.

## 5.5 Adversarial resistance and auditability (receipts, ledgers)

**Goal.** Make it hard to game Φ, Θ, or δ; make it easy to verify that decisions obey the law (unanimity over U) and protocol rules. This section gives an attack model, a receipt standard, a tamper-evident ledger, required audits, and runtime alarms.

---

#### A) Threat model (what attackers try to do)

* **Framing attacks.** Reword s to inflate Φ̂ (violates frame invariance).
* **Lottery laundering / bundling.** Use s ∨ t or s ∧ t to hide an unacceptable branch.
* **Coercion camouflage.** Manufacture “consent” via threats, nudges, opacity.
* **Masking veto layers.** Suppress floors (e.g., checkpoints/immune surveillance) to feign Φ↑.
* **Scope slicing.** Smuggle “affected” in place of “all.”
* **Silent Θ drift.** Lower Θ without warrants or exits.
* **Sybil/astroturf.** Fabricate assent with bots/copies; or erase dissent by throttling.
* **Paper rollback.** Claim reversibility πʳ that fails when invoked.
* **Context averaging.** Replace inf across niches with mean.
* **Evidence cherry-pick.** Drop worst-case sources that lower Φ̂.

Mitigations below are mandatory, not optional.

---

#### B) Receipt: the atomic, auditable δ-decision record

Every δ(s) decision emits a **receipt** (human-readable + machine JSON) containing:

1. **Proposal identity.** Natural language summary; **material-equivalence hash** h(s) (see D).
2. **Regime.** Θ (and Θᵤ/Θₗ if hysteresis); whether Θ=1 or Provisional Use Warrant (PUW) in force.
3. **Φ report.** Φ̂(s) with interval **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**; decomposition showing per-component/path/context values and the exact **min** (or declared t-norm) steps that set Φ̂.
4. **Floors.** List of applicable Gᵍ with evidence for each Gᵍ(s)=1 (or flag 0).
5. **Composition proof.** For conjunction/sequence/disjunction: a short proof trace that the min/max rules of §3.1–§3.2 were applied correctly.
6. **Invariance checks.** References to red-team framings s′ with hashes h(s′)=h(s); any non-match is explained or δ aborted.
7. **Load probes.** Latest step-down test results and current L̂ components {Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ}.
8. **Transformation claims.** If Aᵢ flips (0→1) were invoked: disclose which legitimate modifiers (disclosure, compensation, insurance, opt-in, isolation, rollback) changed **s** (§5.3) and attach contracts/escrows.
9. **PUW extras (Θ<1).** Scope, duration, rollback πʳ (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ), monitoring metrics, exit triggers, and operators.
10. **Signatures & time.** Cryptographic signature of issuer; timestamp; version id.

Receipts are **append-only** on the ledger and referenced by subsequent updates/appeals.

---

#### C) Ledger: tamper-evident, queryable, privacy-respecting

* **Structure.** Append-only log (Merkle-tree or hash-chain) of receipts and audits; each entry includes parent hash → tamper evidence.
* **Versioning.** Each proposal has a **thread** keyed by h(s); updates link forward (diffs), never overwrite.
* **Θ changes.** Every Θ change must anchor a PUW entry; **no silent drift**.
* **Cross-refs.** Link to floor tests, step-down traces, isolation leakage reports, rollback drills.
* **Access.** Read-public by default; privacy guardrails for sensitive evidence (see I).
* **Query API.** Given h(s), return the full decision lineage; given time windows, list all Θ<1 decisions; filter by floors or contexts.

---

#### D) Material-equivalence hash (h)

**Purpose.** Prevent framing games: materially equivalent descriptions of s must map to the same hash.

**Method (conceptual).**

1. **Normalize.** Parse s into a **semantic graph**: actors, resources, timing that changes outcomes, rights/obligations, reversibility, contexts, floors. Strip labels, sort sets, canonicalize units.
2. **Erase frames.** Remove synonyms, UI text, marketing claims; keep only material predicates.
3. **Canon form.** Emit a stable serialization of the graph; include composition operators (∧, ∘, ∨ with regime flag), and floor references.
4. **Hash.** Apply a cryptographic hash to the canonical form → **h(s)**.

**Rule.** If two proposals claim to be “the same,” they must share h(s). Non-matching hashes demand either (i) show material differences or (ii) abort δ.

---

#### E) Required audits (automated + human)

* **Frame-invariance audit.** Red-team re-descriptions; verify h(s′)=h(s) and Φ̂(s′)=Φ̂(s).
* **Monotonicity audit.** Check that adding content never increased Φ̂ and removing content never reduced it (ΔΦ̂ ≤ 0 for ∧/∘; ΔΦ̂ ≥ 0 for deletions).
* **Composition audit.** Recompute Φ̂ for each component and path; verify the min rules and any certified max cases (individualized disjunction).
* **Context audit.** Ensure **inf** across contexts is used unless isolation is certified; verify leakage bound ε and isolation evidence.
* **Floor audit.** Independently reproduce Gᵍ(s) tests; stress interactions Hᵍ(s, t).
* **Load step-down.** Periodically drop props; if s degrades, flag L̂>0 and escalate.
* **Rollback drill.** Invoke πʳ in controlled settings on schedule; failed drills auto-invalidate δ(s)=1 for Θ<1 regimes.
* **Evidence ablation.** Leave-one-source-out recompute of Φ̂; large swings trigger scrutiny (cherry-pick detection).

All audit outcomes are posted to the ledger and referenced by receipts.

---

#### F) Red-team program & bounty

* **Mandate.** Independent teams attempt: frame manipulation, lottery laundering, context averaging, fake isolation, bogus compensation, rollback failure induction, Θ-drift.
* **Access.** Sandboxed replicas, anonymized decision traces, synthetic test cases.
* **Rewards.** Public bounty tiers for reproducible exploits; fixes are logged with new hashes and version bumps.
* **Non-retaliation.** Reporting channels protected; retaliation attempts are ledger-logged and sanctionable.

---

#### G) Runtime metrics & alarms

* **Invariance score.** Fraction of red-team frames with |Φ̂(s′)−Φ̂(s)|=0; alarms on drift.
* **Manipulation-risk index.** Weighted flags for coercive patterns (timing pressure, essential-needs leverage, dark-pattern evidence).
* **Load trend.** Rolling average of L̂ components; rising trend under Θ<1 triggers exit.
* **Abstention rate.** Share of proposals with Φₗ<Θ; sudden drops may signal estimator laxity.
* **Rollback health.** πʳ success rate, median tᵣ, cᵣ; failure or latency spikes → freeze δ(s)=1 for similar classes.
* **Floor health.** Pass/fail rates on Gᵍ stress tests; correlation with incidents.

---

#### H) Minimal APIs (sketch)

* **POST /receipts** → store receipt; returns ledger index and hash.
* **GET /receipts/{h}** → full decision lineage for proposal h.
* **GET /audits?type=frame|mono|compose** → latest audit packs for a class.
* **GET /metrics** → invariance score, load trends, rollback health, abstention rate.
* **POST /report** → submit red-team finding (signed); creates a ledger case.

---

#### I) Privacy & ethics of logging

* **No raw Aᵢ harvesting.** The law is unanimity over U; protocols should not build person-indexed files of assent. Store **class-level** evidence, contracts, and floor tests.
* **Differential privacy (when needed).** If aggregated surveys are used as *evidence*, add DP noise and store only aggregates + proofs.
* **Minimal retention.** Keep what is necessary to audit Φ̂, Θ, δ; purge PII unless legally required; always log purges.
* **Counter-astroturf.** Sign and rate-limit submissions; weigh sources by provenance, not volume.

---

#### J) Examples (concise)

**Example 1 — Θ=1 admit.**

* h(s)=abc…; Φ̂=1.00 with \[1.00,1.00]; components: {A:1, B:1}; path min=1; floors {Gᵍ}=1; invariance: 15/15; load step-down: L̂→0; receipt signed, time T. → δ=1, ledger idx #1024.

**Example 2 — Θ=1 reject (pruned).**

* h(s)=def…; Φ̂=0.98 \[0.93,0.99]; veto at step B (Φ\_B=0.93); floor Gᵍ ok; invariance 12/12; → δ=0. Publish “what would raise Φ”: redesign B with rollback + compensation.

**Example 3 — Θ<1 provisional with PUW.**

* h(s)=ghi…; Θ=0.95; Φ̂=0.96 \[0.94,0.98]; πʳ: pᵣ=0.99, cᵣ low, tᵣ=2h; monitoring metrics; exit triggers set; isolation ε≤0.01 verified. Rollback drill monthly. Receipt + PUW logged. Alarms armed.

---

**Compact formal ties.**

* **Frame invariance:** h(s)=h(s′) ⇒ Φ̂(s)=Φ̂(s′) (within tolerance); else flag.
* **Composition safety:** For any decomposition D(s), receipt must show **Φ̂(s)=min over D(s)** (or declared T), never an average that can mask a veto.
* **Monotone law:** Adding content cannot raise Φ̂; if observed, receipt is invalid.

---

**Bottom line.** Adversarial resistance is not a vibe; it’s a discipline. Hash the meaning, not the marketing; prove min-composition; log floors; run step-downs; drill rollbacks; forbid silent Θ drift; publish receipts; and keep a tamper-evident ledger. If someone can’t pass these checks, they shouldn’t be setting δ(s)=1.

# 6. Estimating Φ in Practice

## 6.1 Evidence classes (empirical, legal, historical, normative)

**Purpose.** Protocols estimate **Φ(s)** (with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**) without changing the law. Evidence comes in four mutually reinforcing classes. Any class can **lower** Φ; none may “average away” a valid veto. All items must be **frame-invariant**, **tamper-auditable**, and mapped to **Aᵢ**, **Gᵍ**, **L**, and the δ-receipt (§5.5).

---

#### A) Empirical evidence (measurements, experiments, audits)

**Scope.** Facts about how s behaves in the world (or high-fidelity sandbox).

* **Inputs.** Trials (opt-in), A/B tests with isolation ε, simulations validated against ground truth, step-down tests for **L(s)**, floor stress tests **Gᵍ(s)**, rollback drills πʳ.
* **How it moves Φ.**

  * Failing floors or rising load → **Φ↓** via **Gᵍ=0** or **L>0**.
  * Demonstrated reversal, isolation, or compensation that changes **s** → some **Aᵢ:0→1** ⇒ **Φ↑** legitimately.
* **Quality gates.** Pre-registered protocols; blinding where relevant; leakage audits; reproducibility; power analysis.
* **Anti-abuse.** No context-averaging: use **inf** across niches; disallow synthetic scarcity/pressure; forbid mixing opt-in and non-participants.
* **Ledger hooks.** Attach datasets (hashes), lab notebooks, isolation proofs, πʳ metrics, step-down traces.

---

#### B) Legal evidence (statutes, case law, treaties, rights charters)

**Scope.** Authoritative signals about **codified** constraints and enforceable expectations.

* **Inputs.** Constitutional provisions, court holdings, regulatory standards, international agreements, due-process requirements.
* **How it moves Φ.**

  * Conflicts with hard rights or due process → **Φ↓** (often as floors: **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ(s)=0**).
  * Clear legal permissions do **not** guarantee admissibility; they are **supportive** only if consistent with other classes.
* **Separation.** **Legality ≠ admissibility.** The law is unanimity over **U**; legal evidence is an indicator, not the arbiter.
* **Quality gates.** Jurisdictional relevance; recency; binding vs persuasive weight; documented interpretive range.
* **Anti-abuse.** No venue-shopping; multi-jurisdiction conflicts trigger **abstention** or isolation.
* **Ledger hooks.** Cite provisions (ids), attach reasoning, note conflicts, and map each legal item to the relevant **Gᵍ** or **Aᵢ** semantics.

---

#### C) Historical evidence (track records, precedents, long-run load)

**Scope.** What happened under materially equivalent s′ in the past.

* **Inputs.** Case studies, incident databases, prior deployments, longitudinal measures of **L(s′)** and floor breaches **Gᵍ(s′)=0**.
* **How it moves Φ.**

  * Recurrent **L>0** under step-down or repeated floor failures ⇒ **Φ↓** for s with the same **h(s)** (material-equivalence hash).
  * Stable **L→0** histories with robust audits support **Φ↑** (never above 1 unless all classes align).
* **Quality gates.** Match by **h(s)**; control for context differences; avoid survivorship bias.
* **Anti-abuse.** Marketing reframes do not change **h(s)**; cherry-picked “successes” fail leave-one-out ablations.
* **Ledger hooks.** Link to the decision lineage of prior s′, with outcomes and step-down logs.

---

#### D) Normative evidence (first-principles reasons, charters of value)

**Scope.** Reasoned arguments bearing on **Aᵢ(s)** under informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured conditions.

* **Inputs.** Public deliberation records, stakeholder reasons matrices, expert ethical analyses, rights-based arguments, minority reports.
* **How it moves Φ.**

  * A standing, unresolved reason from any locus in **U** → **Aᵢ=0** ⇒ **Φ↓**.
  * Redesigns (compensation, opt-in isolation, guarantees, reversibility) that address reasons → **Aᵢ:0→1** ⇒ **Φ↑**.
* **Quality gates.** Plain-language statements; time for comprehension; representation for absent standpoints; conflict-of-interest disclosures.
* **Anti-abuse.** No coercion, nudges, or dark patterns; parallel red-team facilitation to test framing invariance.
* **Ledger hooks.** Attach deliberation receipts, objections→redesign mappings, and proof of non-manufacture audits.

---

#### E) Synthesis and aggregation (how evidence becomes Φ̂ with \[Φₗ, Φᵤ])

* **Per-evidence item Eⱼ.** Convert to a bounded claim about one or more predicates:

  * **A-claims:** “for class c, Aᵢ(s)=1” (with coverage and counterfactual assumptions).
  * **G-claims:** “Gᵍ(s)=1/0 under stress X.”
  * **L-claims:** “step-down shows L(s)→0 / >0.”
    Each claim carries uncertainty **\[ℓⱼ, uⱼ]**.
* **Conservative fusion.** For components and contexts, use **min** (or a declared stricter t-norm **T**). Never average across dissent.

  * **Φₗ(s) = minⱼ ℓⱼ**, **Φᵤ(s) = minⱼ uⱼ** after aligning on material equivalence and composition (paths, conjunctions, disjunctions per §3.2).
* **Veto dominance.** Any credible **Aᵢ=0**, **Gᵍ=0**, or **L>0 (step-down)** forces **Φᵤ<1**; at Θ=1 this yields **δ=0**.

---

#### F) Provenance, calibration, and weighting (without averaging away vetoes)

* **Provenance score ρⱼ.** Track source reliability, independence, and reproducibility.
* **Use of ρⱼ.** Tighten or widen **\[ℓⱼ, uⱼ]**; do **not** up-weight to drown a veto.
* **Calibration reports.** Periodically measure coverage: P(Φ ∈ \[Φₗ,Φᵤ]) ≥ τ. Missed coverage ⇒ stricter abstention.
* **Decomposition duty.** Publish a per-component breakdown so the **min** step is visible and auditable.

---

#### G) Micro-examples (one per class)

* **Empirical.** Opt-in pilot of s with isolation ε≤0.01 passes; step-down shows **L→0**; floors **Gᵍ=1** ⇒ **Φ̂↑**.
* **Legal.** Court finds warrantless biometric sweep unlawful in jurisdiction J (rights floor). For s with h(s)=… ⇒ **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ=0** ⇒ **Φ̂↓**.
* **Historical.** Prior program s′ (h-match) required chronic persuasion and policing; step-down collapse documented ⇒ **L>0** ⇒ **Φ̂↓** for s.
* **Normative.** Deliberation reveals uncompensated risk to a minority; redesign adds insurance + opt-in isolation; audited non-manufacture; affected Aᵢ flip to 1 ⇒ **Φ̂↑**.

---

#### H) Pitfalls and red-team tests

* **Pitfalls.** Context averaging, survivorship bias, venue shopping, coercive “consent,” proxy leakage, silent Θ drift, Sybil assent.
* **Red-team tests.**

  * **Frame invariance:** rephrase s → require **h(s′)=h(s)** and **Φ̂(s′)=Φ̂(s)**.
  * **Leave-one-out:** remove each evidence source; large Φ̂ swings ⇒ fragility.
  * **Step-down:** relax props; if s degrades, **L>0** flag stands.
  * **Isolation falsification:** inject tracers to detect ε>0 leakage.
  * **Floor stress:** adversarial workloads to probe **Gᵍ** boundaries.

---

#### I) Evidence item schema (for receipts)

Each item attaches to the δ-receipt with:

* **kind:** empirical | legal | historical | normative
* **claim:** Aᵢ=1/0, Gᵍ=1/0, L→0/>0, or composition fact
* **h(s):** material-equivalence hash bound to which content the claim refers
* **method:** protocol summary; prereg id; power; blinding/controls
* **scope/time:** populations, contexts, windows; leakage ε if isolation claimed
* **uncertainty:** **\[ℓ, u]** and calibration notes
* **provenance:** source, independence, conflicts, signatures
* **links:** datasets, rulings, transcripts, stress logs, rollback drills
* **effect-on-Φ:** explicit mapping used in the **min** fusion

---

**Bottom line.** Empirical, legal, historical, and normative evidence are **and-composed** checks on the same target: unanimity over **U**. Any one can lower Φ; raising Φ requires *changing s* so real vetoes become real acceptances. Protocols fuse evidence conservatively into **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**, publish receipts, and keep δ faithful to the law.

## 6.2 Uncertainty handling: intervals for Φ(s), safe aggregation (e.g., min or other t-norms)

**Goal.** Treat uncertainty explicitly so δ-decisions stay faithful to the law. We represent what is known about acceptability with **intervals**, aggregate them with **conservative operators**, and decide with **guardrails**.

---

#### A) Interval representation

* **Estimator.** For each proposal s, report **Φ̂(s)** with an uncertainty band **\[Φₗ(s), Φᵤ(s)]**, where 0 ≤ Φₗ ≤ Φ ≤ Φᵤ ≤ 1 and coverage is calibrated (e.g., ≥ τ).
* **Unknowns.** If a required component has no credible evidence, set its band to **\[0,1]** (unknown is *not* acceptance).
* **Resolution.** Use an explicit tolerance ε ≥ 0 for measurement limits; treat “Φₗ ≥ 1−ε” as “within resolution of 1.”

---

#### B) Safe aggregation (operators and contexts)

Let **\[xₗ,xᵤ]** and **\[yₗ,yᵤ]** be interval inputs.

**Conjunction / add content (s ∧ t).**

* Point rule: Φ(s ∧ t) = min(Φ(s), Φ(t)).
* Interval rule: **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ] = \[ min(xₗ, yₗ), min(xᵤ, yᵤ) ]**.

**Sequencing / paths (s ∘ t ∘ …).**

* Point rule: Φ(path) = min over steps.
* Interval rule: **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ] = \[ min of all step-lower-bounds, min of all step-upper-bounds ]**.

**Disjunction without individualized assignment (s ∨ t).**

* Point rule: Φ = min(Φ(s), Φ(t)).
* Interval rule: **\[ min(xₗ, yₗ), min(xᵤ, yᵤ) ]**.

**Disjunction with certified individualized opt-in/opt-out.**

* Point rule: Φ = max(Φ(s), Φ(t)).
* Interval rule: **\[ max(xₗ, yₗ), max(xᵤ, yᵤ) ]**.
* Certification must appear in the receipt (assignment proof, isolation, rollback).

**Contexts / niches.**

* Point rule: Φ(s) = inf over relevant contexts k of Φ(s|k).
* Interval rule: compute per-context bands **\[Φₗᵏ, Φᵤᵏ]**, then **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ] = \[ minₖ Φₗᵏ, minₖ Φᵤᵏ ]**.
* Isolation claims switch evaluation to the certified context only and must include leakage bound ε in the receipt.

**Group floors.**

* Treat each floor **Gᵍ(s)** as an interval **\[gₗ, gᵤ] ⊆ \[0,1]** (often {0,1}).
* Compose by min with Φ: **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ] ← \[ min(Φₗ, gₗ), min(Φᵤ, gᵤ) ]**.

---

#### C) Admissible t-norms (when stricter than min is desired)

* A **t-norm** T is acceptable for aggregation only if it preserves veto semantics: **T(x,1)=x**, **T(x,0)=0**, **T(x,y) ≤ min(x,y)**, monotone in each argument, and frame-invariant.
* **Defaults.** Use **min**. Stricter choices (e.g., product x·y, Łukasiewicz max(0, x+y−1)) may be declared *per class of risks* to reflect interaction hazards, but must be published in receipts.
* **Never** use averages or weighted sums that can exceed min and mask a valid veto.

---

#### D) Updating, dependence, and conflicts

* **Multiple evidence items for the same component.** Intersect bands: **\[ℓ,u] ← \[ max(ℓ₁,ℓ₂,…), min(u₁,u₂,…) ]**.
* **Dependence.** If sources are not independent, do **not** tighten bands on that basis; widen when in doubt. Provenance scores affect band width, not the aggregation rule.
* **Conflicts (ℓ>u).** Log as incoherent; abstain or revert to sandboxing until reconciled.

---

#### E) Decision logic under uncertainty

For a chosen threshold Θ:

* **Admit (universal regime).** δ(s)=1 only if **Φₗ(s) ≥ Θ** and all floor lower bounds equal 1 (within ε).
* **Reject.** If **Φᵤ(s) < Θ**, δ(s)=0.
* **Abstain / Provisional.** If **Φₗ(s) < Θ ≤ Φᵤ(s)**, abstain at Θ=1; at Θ<1, proceed only with a Provisional Use Warrant (rollback πʳ, monitoring, exit triggers) per §5.2–§3.3.

---

#### F) Calibration and safeguards

* **Coverage.** Track empirical coverage P(Φ ∈ \[Φₗ,Φᵤ]) ≥ τ; if coverage slips, tighten defaults (more abstention).
* **Leave-one-out ablations.** Recompute **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** without each evidence source; large swings trigger review (fragility or cherry-picking).
* **Step-down linkage.** Periodically relax compensations; if s degrades, record **L>0** and lower Φₗ accordingly.
* **Hysteresis (optional).** Use Θᵤ ≥ Θₗ to avoid flapping: set δ=1 when Φₗ ≥ Θᵤ; keep δ=1 while Φₗ ≥ Θₗ; else δ=0 (log both thresholds).

---

#### G) Worked micro-examples

1. **Conjunction with one weak limb.** A:\[0.98,1.00], B:\[0.92,0.97] ⇒ s=A∧B has **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]=\[0.92,0.97]**; at Θ=1, δ=0.
2. **Individualized disjunction.** Branches \[0.60,0.80] and \[0.95,1.00]; with certified choice: **\[0.95,1.00]**; without it: **\[0.60,0.80]**.
3. **Contexts.** Two niches bands \[0.99,1.00], \[0.85,0.90] ⇒ pooled **\[0.85,0.90]**; isolation to niche 1 with ε≤0.01 restores **\[0.99,1.00]** (receipt must prove isolation).
4. **Unknown floor.** Φ core \[0.98,1.00], rights floor **\[0,1]** ⇒ overall **\[0,1]** ⇒ abstain.

---

**One-line rule.** Compute **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** with min-style (or stricter t-norm) composition across parts, paths, contexts, and floors; unknowns default to **\[0,1]**; compare **Φₗ** to **Θ**; when in doubt, **don’t lock in**—use reversibility and sandboxing to legitimately raise Φ.

## 6.3 Error models and harm bounds; deferral rules

**Goal.** Make uncertainty actionable by (i) naming the **errors** we can make about Φ(s), (ii) setting **harm bounds** that must never be exceeded (especially for irreversible harms), and (iii) giving **deferral rules** that force abstention or tightly bounded pilots when the error–harm product is unsafe.

---

#### A) Error model (relative to Θ and the law)

* **Estimation band.** Protocols report **Φ̂(s)** with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** (coverage ≥ τ). Let **ΔΦ = Φᵤ − Φₗ**.
* **Type I (false admit).** δ(s)=1 while **Φ<Θ**. At Θ=1, this means we actualized a contradiction-bearing state (some Aᵢ=0) ⇒ **L(s)>0** by §2.5.
* **Type II (false reject).** δ(s)=0 while **Φ≥Θ**. At Θ=1, we delayed an admissible state (opportunity cost, no rights violation).
* **Asymmetry.** Under unanimity, Type I is categorically worse than Type II. Policies must weight them accordingly: err **closed** (δ=0) when in doubt.

**Margin rule (risk-tuned).** For actions with higher harm potential, require a **safety margin m>0**:

* Admit only if **Φₗ ≥ Θ + m** where m grows with potential harm and irreversibility (see §6.3C).

---

#### B) Harm bounds (what must be bounded before acting)

Let **H(s)** summarize the worst credible harm of s under informed modeling, decomposed as:

* **Hⁱʳʳ(s)** — **irreversible** harm (death, non-remediable injury, non-erasable disclosure, ecological release without recapture).
* **Hʳᵉᵛ(s)** — **reversible** harm with guaranteed rollback cost **cᵣ(s)** and latency **tᵣ(s)** (from πʳ).
* **Hˡᵒᵃᵈ(s)** — expected normative maintenance burden tied to contradiction (**proxy of L(s)** under step-down).

**Global caps (must be declared ex ante).**

* **Bⁱʳʳ** — zero or near-zero cap for Hⁱʳʳ in pilots (often **Bⁱʳʳ=0**).
* **Bʳᵉᵛ, Cʳ, Tʳ** — caps on reversible harm, rollback cost, and latency.
* **Bˡᵒᵃᵈ** — cap on allowable load indicators during provisional runs.

**Robust risk measure.** Use a conservative functional **R(s)**, e.g.,

* **R(s)=sup over model class ℳ of H(s)** (worst-case within vetted models), or
* **R(s)=CVaRₚ\[H(s)]** at high p (e.g., 0.99) with stress scenarios.
  Admit provisionally only if **R(s) ≤ declared caps** **and** **Φₗ ≥ Θʳ** (a provisional threshold ≥ Θ minus a small ε, with all §5.2 safeguards).

---

#### C) Deferral rules (fail-closed policies)

**Hard deferrals (automatic δ=0).**

1. **Unknown floors.** Any floor Gᵍ(s) has band \[0,1] or fails stress tests → abstain.
2. **Irreversibility unresolved.** Hⁱʳʳ(s) not proven ≤ Bⁱʳʳ (typically 0) **or** πʳ missing/untested → abstain.
3. **Band conflict.** Evidence incoherent (Φ-band with ℓ>u) or ΔΦ too wide for the harm class → abstain.
4. **Framing failure.** Material-equivalence hash mismatch or invariance audit fails → abstain.
5. **Context averaging.** Pooled evaluation used where **inf** across contexts is required → abstain.
6. **Manipulation risk.** Non-manufacture audit fails (coercion/misinformation) → abstain.

**Soft deferrals (sandbox instead).**

* If **Φₗ < Θ** but **R(s) within strict pilot caps**, run **S2/S3 sandbox** (§5.2C) with **opt-in**, **isolation** (leakage ε bounded), and **πʳ** certified. The sandbox is designed to *change s* (compensation, guarantees) so Aᵢ:0→1 and Φ rises.

**Safety margins by harm class.** Let classes be:

* **C1 trivial, reversible** → m≈0, small pilots allowed.
* **C2 moderate, reversible** → m>0; πʳ must have low cᵣ and tᵣ; narrow caps.
* **C3 serious, partially reversible** → large m; small, opt-in trials only; stronger monitoring; short T\*.
* **C4 serious, irreversible** → **no Θ<1** pilots; **δ=0** unless **Φₗ=1** (within ε) **and** floors verified.

---

#### D) Monitoring, alarms, and dynamic exit

During any provisional δ=1:

* **Live bands.** Update **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** continuously; widen under drift.
* **Load sentinels.** Track L̂ components {Lᵐᵃᵗ, Lᶦⁿᶠ, Lⁱⁿˢ}; rising trends flag contradiction.
* **Exit triggers (auto).** Execute πʳ and set δ=0 if **any**:

  * Φₗ drops below Θ (or Θₗ with hysteresis),
  * floor predicate flips (Gᵍ=0),
  * **R(s)** exceeds caps (Bⁱʳʳ, Bʳᵉᵛ, Bˡᵒᵃᵈ),
  * rollback feasibility pᵣ falls below p\* or cᵣ/tᵣ exceed caps,
  * invariance audit starts failing.

**Post-exit duties.** Publish restitution (if any), update Γ/Φ analysis, and log lessons to the ledger (§5.5).

---

#### E) Formal guards (inequalities to check)

Let **ε** be measurement tolerance.

* **Universal admit (Θ=1):** δ(s)=1 only if **Φₗ ≥ 1−ε** and **∀g, Gᵍ(s)=1** with verified tests; else δ=0.
* **Provisional admit (Θ<1):** δ(s)=1 only if
  **Φₗ ≥ Θʳ**, **R(s) ≤ caps**, **πʳ meets (pᵣ ≥ p\*, cᵣ ≤ Cʳ, tᵣ ≤ Tʳ)**, **isolation ε\_leak ≤ ε\***, and a PUW is logged.
* **Type-I risk bound:** choose α so that **P(Φ<Θ | evidence) ≤ α**, with α set by harm class (e.g., α≤10⁻⁶ for C4).
* **Margin by harm:** require **m = f(Hⁱʳʳ, Hʳᵉᵛ, Bˡᵒᵃᵈ)** so that **Φₗ ≥ Θ + m** before universal admit.

---

#### F) Micro-examples (applied)

1. **C2 feature flag (reversible).** Φ̂=\[0.94,0.99], Θ=1 ⇒ universal admit fails. PUW with Θʳ=0.95, πʳ(tᵣ=2 min, cᵣ low), isolation to 1% opt-in, Bⁱʳʳ=0, Bʳᵉᵛ small. Live bands rise to \[0.99,1.00]; graduate to Θ=1 only when Φₗ=1 (ε).
2. **C4 biometric dragnet (irreversible exposure).** Floors partly unknown; Φ̂=\[0.70,0.95], Hⁱʳʳ>0. Hard deferral: δ=0. Only acceptable if proposal is redesigned (opt-in, strict warrants, reversible retention) and Φₗ→1 with floors verified.
3. **C3 environmental release.** Φ̂=\[0.97,0.995], πʳ uncertain (recapture not guaranteed), Hⁱʳʳ>0 ⇒ **no pilot** under Θ<1. Redesign to ex vivo sandbox; re-evaluate.

---

#### G) Operator checklist (one screen)

* ✔ Map harm class (C1–C4) and set **m, caps, α**.
* ✔ Compute **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**, verify floors, and run invariance audit.
* ✔ If Θ=1: admit only if **Φₗ ≥ 1−ε**; else abstain.
* ✔ If Θ<1: verify **PUW**, **πʳ**, **R(s) ≤ caps**, isolation, monitoring, exits.
* ✔ Arm alarms; schedule step-down tests; log all to the ledger.

---

**Bottom line.** Treat uncertainty with **bands, margins, and caps**; accept the asymmetry (false admits are worse than false rejects); and hard-wire **deferral** when irreversibility, unknown floors, or incoherent evidence appear. If we cannot bound harm and error tightly, we do not lock in.

### 6.4 Reporting standards: receipt formats and δ-decision logs

**Purpose.** Make every δ-decision reconstructible, frame-invariant, and tamper-evident. This section fixes a minimal, auditable **receipt** and an append-only **decision log** schema.

---

#### A) Receipt (atomic δ-decision record)

Every δ(s) evaluation emits a **receipt**—human-readable plus a machine payload. Fields marked **\[req]** are mandatory.

**Human header (one page).**

* **Title & summary** \[req] — plain-language description of s.
* **Decision** \[req] — δ(s) ∈ {1, 0}, regime (Θ=1 or Θ<1), timestamp, issuer.
* **Bottom line** \[req] — one sentence why (which min step controlled Φ).

**Machine payload (JSON; canonical keys, order fixed).**

```

**Receipt content rules.**

* **Material-equivalence hash h(s)** \[req] from §5.5D. Any change in content ⇒ new hash.
* **Φ̂ with interval \[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** \[req], plus the **exact min-controlling element(s)** (component, context, or floor) that set Φₗ.
* **Floors list** \[req] with pass/fail and evidence ids.
* **Composition proof** \[req] that conjunction/sequence/disjunction rules of §3.1–§3.3 were applied.
* **Invariance results** \[req] (red-team frames, all matched h(s)).
* **Step-down summary** \[req] (date, L̂ components).
* **PUW block** (only if Θ<1) with scope, rollback πʳ (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ), monitoring, exit triggers.
* **Signatures** \[req]: issuer, time, prior-entry hash.

---

#### B) Decision log (append-only ledger)

Each receipt is appended to a tamper-evident log; entries are linked by **prev\_hash → hash**.

**Entry schema.**

```
Entry {
  index: integer [req]
  time: ISO-8601 [req]
  kind: DECISION | AUDIT | UPDATE | EXIT | ROLLBACK_DRILL | ALERT | APPEAL [req]
  proposal_hash: h(s) [req]
  prev_entry_hash: hex [req]
  payload_hash: hex [req]
  payload_uri: link (receipt/audit bundle) [req]
  signatures: { issuer: sig, witnesses?: [sig…] } [req]
}
```

**Threading & views.**

* **Thread = all entries with the same h(s)** (decision lineage).
* **Views:** latest decision, PUWs active, Θ changes, floor failures, exits.

**Required log events.**

* **DECISION** — every δ(s) evaluation.
* **AUDIT** — frame-invariance, composition, floors, context, step-down, rollback drill.
* **UPDATE** — material change to s (new h), or to estimation rules (e.g., t-norm).
* **EXIT** — auto-triggered rollback or end of PUW.
* **ROLLBACK\_DRILL** — periodic πʳ test result.
* **ALERT** — alarms: Φₗ↓, floors flip, L̂↑, invariance fail.
* **APPEAL** — challenge outcome with Γ/Φ re-evaluation.

**Retention & privacy.**

* Retain hashes and proofs indefinitely; minimize PII; store only what is needed to audit Φ̂/Θ/δ; log redactions.

---

#### C) Minimal audit bundles (linked by id)

* **A-frame:** alternative framings s′ with h(s′)=h(s), Φ̂(s′)=Φ̂(s).
* **A-compose:** recomputation showing **min** (or declared t-norm) over components/paths/contexts.
* **A-floors:** stress tests and proofs for each Gᵍ(s).
* **A-stepdown:** before/after metrics showing L̂→0 or >0.
* **A-rollback:** πʳ drills (success rate, cᵣ, tᵣ); failures freeze similar PUWs.

---

#### D) Status vocabulary (single word on the receipt)

* **ADMITTED** (Θ=1, Φₗ=1, all floors=1).
* **PRUNED** (Θ=1, Φᵤ<1 or a floor=0).
* **PROVISIONAL** (Θ<1 with PUW, πʳ certified).
* **EXITED** (rollback executed / PUW ended).
* **ABSTAINED** (no action; list missing evidence to raise Φₗ).

---

#### E) Change reporting (semantic diffs)

When s changes, publish a **semantic diff**:

* **Before/after h(s)**, operator (∧, ∘, ∨ regime), floors touched, contexts.
* **Effect on Φ̂:** which component flipped the min; updated \[Φₗ,Φᵤ].
* **Transformations applied** (compensation, insurance, opt-in, isolation, reversibility) per §5.3.

---

#### F) Examples (concise receipts)

**R1 — Θ=1 ADMITTED.**

* **Decision.** δ=1; Φ̂=1.00 \[1.00,1.00]; min set by step C=1.00; floors pass; step-down L̂→0.
* **Why.** All components and contexts at 1 within ε; no upkeep needed.
* **Log.** DECISION#1024 → AUDIT(A-frame, A-compose, A-floors, A-stepdown).

**R2 — Θ=1 PRUNED.**

* **Decision.** δ=0; Φ̂=0.96 \[0.92,0.98]; min at path step B (0.92); G\_rights=1, G\_grid=1.
* **Why.** Sequencing rule (min over steps) blocked; lists redesigns to raise Φ at B.
* **Log.** DECISION#1187; ALERT(L̂ rising under pilot attempt); no PUW allowed.

**R3 — Θ<1 PROVISIONAL with PUW.**

* **Decision.** δ=1; Θ=0.95; Φ̂=0.96 \[0.95,0.98]; isolation ε≤0.01; πʳ pᵣ=0.99, tᵣ=10m, cᵣ low; exits armed (Φₗ<0.95 or Gᵍ flip).
* **Why.** Reversible, opt-in sandbox; goal to convert vetoes via compensation + disclosure.
* **Log.** DECISION#1302 → ROLLBACK\_DRILL (monthly) → EXIT after Φₗ=1 reached.

**One-line rule.** Every δ-decision must be reconstructible from its receipt alone and verifiable against the ledger: hash the meaning, show the min, prove floors, log step-downs, and chain every update—so selection stays faithful to **“Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”**

## 6.5 Red-teaming and manipulation tests

**Purpose.** Systematically probe the selector (Φ, Θ, δ), evidence fusion, and receipts for ways to launder vetoes, fake unanimity, or bypass floors—then make every discovered weakness reproducible, measurable, and fix-tracked.

---

#### A) Objectives and scope

* **Primary goals.** (i) Preserve frame invariance; (ii) block manufactured consent; (iii) enforce min-composition across parts, paths, contexts, and floors; (iv) prevent silent Θ drift; (v) ensure rollback πʳ works on demand.
* **Targets.** Estimators (Φ̂, \[Φₗ,Φᵤ]), δ-gate, floor tests Gᵍ, receipts/ledger, monitoring/exit loops, and governance around Θ.

---

#### B) Attack catalogue → concrete tests

Each attack has a **test**, **expected outcome**, and **receipt hook**.

1. **Framing attack.**
   *Test:* Produce k materially equivalent descriptions s′ of s (UI copy, ordering, labels).
   *Expect:* h(s′)=h(s) and Φ̂(s′)=Φ̂(s) within ε; otherwise **δ abort**.
   *Receipt:* invariance checks list frames, hashes, deviations (must be 0).

2. **Lottery laundering / bundling.**
   *Test:* Propose s ∨ t where t is unacceptable to some class; also s ∧ t with a weak limb.
   *Expect:* Without certified individualized choice, Φ̂(s ∨ t)=min; for ∧, Φ̂=min across limbs; **δ=0** at Θ=1 if any limb <1.
   *Receipt:* disjunction mode; composition proof showing the min step.

3. **Manufactured consent (coercion/opacity/nudges).**
   *Test:* Run acceptance drives with countdowns, essential-needs leverage, dark patterns; remove them (step-down) and re-measure.
   *Expect:* Apparent assent is void; Φ̂ must **not** rise; L̂ spikes during pressure; step-down reduces “assent.”
   *Receipt:* non-manufacture audit; load probes log spikes.

4. **Context averaging.**
   *Test:* Show high Φ̂ in niche A, low in B; attempt pooled averaging.
   *Expect:* Pooled Φ̂ uses **inf** across niches; **δ=0** at Θ=1 unless isolation (ε≤ε\*) is certified.
   *Receipt:* context audit with per-niche bands and leakage tests.

5. **Silent Θ drift.**
   *Test:* Attempt δ=1 with Θ lowered off-ledger or adjusted mid-run.
   *Expect:* **δ abort**; all Θ changes require a PUW entry; ledger shows diff.
   *Receipt:* regime block with Θ, Θᵤ/Θₗ; PUW id; prior hash.

6. **Rollback failure (paper πʳ).**
   *Test:* Surprise drills; invoke πʳ under load and partial failure modes.
   *Expect:* Meet pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ bounds; failures auto-freeze class and **exit**.
   *Receipt:* rollback-drill entries; EXIT if bounds missed.

7. **Sybil/astroturf assent.**
   *Test:* Inject bot/copy “acceptances,” suppress dissent channel.
   *Expect:* Φ̂ weighting ignores volume; provenance gates and DP aggregates resist spam; L̂ rises if dissent suppressed.
   *Receipt:* provenance scores; rate-limit logs; step-down shows hidden L.

8. **Floor gaming (masking).**
   *Test:* Raise Φ by disabling checkpoints/immune detection or flooding resources.
   *Expect:* Counts as content change; floors flip (Gᵍ=0) or Φ drops after step-down; **δ=0** at Θ=1.
   *Receipt:* floor audit; adversary label on masking.

9. **Path laundering.**
   *Test:* Split an unacceptable move into micro-steps.
   *Expect:* Φ(path)=min over steps; any unacceptable step blocks δ.
   *Receipt:* path decomposition with min-controlling step.

10. **Estimator tampering / cherry-pick.**
    *Test:* Remove worst-case sources; swap aggregation to averages.
    *Expect:* Leave-one-out ablation reveals large swings; policy forbids averages; audit fails and **δ aborts**.
    *Receipt:* ablation panel; aggregation rule pinned to min or declared t-norm.

11. **Hash games (semantic drift).**
    *Test:* Add subtle content change that slips past h(s).
    *Expect:* Canonical semantic graph updates → new h; mismatch triggers re-evaluation.
    *Receipt:* material-equivalence hash and diff section.

12. **Data poisoning (training/surveys).**
    *Test:* Insert biased data to inflate Φ̂.
    *Expect:* Provenance and robustness checks widen bands; Φₗ falls; abstention or sandbox only.
    *Receipt:* provenance weights; calibration report.

---

#### C) Test harness and schedule

* **Cadence.** Continuous fuzzing + weekly scripted suites + quarterly red-team exercises.
* **Harness.** Synthetic proposal generator (compositions, contexts, floors), frame mutator, lottery/sequence builders, isolation falsifier (leakage injectors), and receipt linter.
* **Dual control.** Red-team (attack) vs blue-team (fix) roles separated; changes require cross-sign.

---

#### D) Instrumentation & metrics

* **Invariance score:** % frames with |ΔΦ̂|=0 (target ≥ 0.99).
* **Composition compliance:** % receipts whose min step is correctly identified (target 1.00).
* **PUW hygiene:** Θ changes with PUW logged (target 1.00); *silent drift rate* = 0.
* **Rollback health:** πʳ success rate, median tᵣ, cᵣ (thresholds per class).
* **Load trend under tests:** L̂ rises when pressure is applied; falls to 0 after step-down in true admits.
* **Ablation fragility:** max ΔΦ̂ across leave-one-out (flag if > ε\_abl).

All metrics appear on a **live dashboard** and are snapshotted into the ledger.

---

#### E) Pass/fail, escalation, and fixes

* **Pass:** All metrics meet thresholds; no exploit yields δ=1 at Θ=1 unless Φ̂=1 and floors=1.
* **Fail:** Any exploit that (i) raises Φ̂ via framing, coercion, averaging, or masking; (ii) yields δ=1 with unresolved floor; (iii) bypasses PUW for Θ<1; or (iv) defeats rollback.
* **Escalation:** Immediate freeze of affected class; issue ALERT; open an **APPEAL/FIX** thread with root-cause analysis, patch, and re-tests; publish diff to aggregation rules or hash canon if changed.

---

#### F) Bounty program (external red-team)

* **Scope:** Framing breaks, min-rule violations, isolation falsification, Θ drift, receipt forgery, rollback failures.
* **Rewards:** Tiered by severity and reproducibility; paid on ledger.
* **Non-retaliation:** Protected channels; all reports and dispositions logged.

---

#### G) Minimal red-team playbook (operators’ checklist)

* Generate s and k frames s′ → verify h(s′)=h(s), Φ̂ equal.
* Compose s with weak limb t (∧), risky step u (∘), and lottery v (∨) → ensure min rules trigger and disjunction mode is correct.
* Attempt “consent” under pressure → run step-down and check L̂ spikes, Φ̂ neutral.
* Mix contexts; test isolation with tracer leakage ε; require **inf** unless ε≤ε\*.
* Try silent Θ change → confirm PUW is mandatory.
* Drill πʳ unannounced; record pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ.
* Do leave-one-out ablations on evidence sources; watch ΔΦ̂.
* Try masking floors; step-down must reveal collapse or load.

---

#### H) Falsifiers for our defenses (what would indict the protocol)

Any reproducible demonstration of the following, captured on the ledger, forces revision:

1. **Frame lift:** Φ̂(s′)−Φ̂(s)≫ε with h(s′)=h(s).
2. **Averaging escape:** δ=1 at Θ=1 achieved by averaging away a valid veto.
3. **Isolation sham:** certified ε≤ε\* overturned by tracer tests.
4. **Rollback mirage:** πʳ fails to meet pᵣ/cᵣ/tᵣ when invoked.
5. **Θ drift:** δ decisions with Θ changed off-ledger.
6. **Floor dodge:** long-run **L→0** despite documented floor violation **without** compensations (contradicting §3.4).

---

**One-line rule.** Red-team until laundering a veto is **harder** than redesigning s to resolve it—then publish the tests, metrics, and fixes so anyone can verify we’re still selecting only what is **acceptable to all**.

# 7. Empirical Program and Tests

## 7.1 Biology: hypermutator stress (r-layer), checkpoint/immune guards (q/a/i)

**Why this exemplar.** Hypermutation and guard pathways give a clean, present-tense view of the stacked-veto logic: replication/repair fidelity (**r**), checkpoint gating (**q**), self-termination (**a**), and immune surveillance (**i**) jointly prune variants; any failing layer installs a veto that shows up as maintenance load **L(v)>0** unless masked.

---

#### A) Hypermutator stress ⇒ r(v)↓ and immediate load

* **Content.** Mismatch-repair loss or proofreading defects create **hypermutation**, elevating replication errors and repair alarms.
* **Selector view.** **r(v) < 1** for many nearby edits; even “neutral” edits ride a noisy background that trips checkpoints and repair.
* **Load signature.** Elevated repair signaling, fork stress, error-correction throughput, and chronic arrest/clearance pressures → **L(v)>0** under step-down (no props).
* **Group floors.** Tissue integrity **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ** and organismal viability **Gᵒʳᵍ** degrade as mutation burden accumulates; local clonal advantage does not license floor violations.

**Micro-assay (paired lines).**
Isogenic control vs hypermutator; introduce barcoded edits; track: mutation accrual, checkpoint markers, arrest/apoptosis fractions, competitive fitness, and immune co-culture clearance. Expect: enrichment of low-Φ variants in the hypermutator line but with higher **L̂** and floor stress.

---

#### B) Checkpoint guards (q): p53/p21/p16 axes as veto enforcers

* **Content.** DNA-damage sensors block cycle progression when integrity is at risk.
* **Selector view.** With intact checkpoints, **q(v) < 1** whenever replication/repair can’t certify safety; δ(v)=0 at Θ=1.
* **Masking fallacy.** Disabling checkpoints to “raise acceptance” does not increase **Φ₍DNA₎** legitimately; it changes **s**, typically flipping higher-scale floors to 0 (uncontrolled proliferation).
* **Load signature.** If checkpoints are suppressed, contradictions migrate: more immune alerts, architectural breakdown, and therapeutic dependence → **L(v)>0**.

**Step-down test.**
If a variant “passes” only under checkpoint inhibitors, withdraw them: admissible variants persist (Φ→1, **L→0**); masked ones collapse or incur **L>0**.

---

#### C) Apoptosis/senescence (a): self-termination as hard veto

* **Content.** Irreparable damage or oncogenic signaling triggers programmed death or durable arrest.
* **Selector view.** **a(v) = 1** iff v does not provoke persistent apoptosis/senescence in context. Any sustained trigger sets **a(v) < 1**, vetoing δ at Θ=1.
* **Load signature.** Chronic cell loss/remodeling, inflammatory debris clearance, fibrosis risk → institutional/material upkeep in tissues (part of **L**).

**Assay hints.**
Annexin V/PI, caspase activation, TUNEL, SA-β-gal, mitochondrial potential; map thresholds where **a(v)** flips from transient to persistent.

---

#### D) Immune surveillance (i): clearance of out-of-spec variants

* **Content.** Neoepitopes, stress ligands, or “missing self” invite NK/T-cell targeting.
* **Selector view.** **i(v) < 1** when sustained recognition elicits elimination pressure; δ(v)=0 at Θ=1.
* **Evasion ≠ admissibility.** Engineering immune evasion can appear to raise **i(v)** locally, but if it exhausts or disables systemic immunity, **Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ(v)=0** (group floor) and **Φ*₍DNA₎*\* falls.

**Isolation redesign.**
If a proposal confines v to an immune-isolated compartment with audited leakage ε≈0, evaluate **i(v)** in that niche and log the isolation guarantee; this legitimately changes **s**.

---

#### E) Putting it together: Φ₍DNA₎ and floors

* **Field.** **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v) }**; at organism scale use \**Φ*₍DNA₎ = min(Φ₍DNA₎, Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ, Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ, Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ, Gᵒʳᵍ)\*\*.
* **Load link.** Any sub-unit value < 1 creates ongoing corrective processes; after step-down of props, **L(v)>0** unless all clearances and floors are at 1.
* **Design levers (legitimate Φ↑).** Safer edit geometry, dosage/localization control, certified isolation, guaranteed rollback, and targeted compensation at higher scales.

---

#### F) Predictions & falsifiers (focused on r/q/a/i)

* **P1 (hypermutation cliffs).** As background mutagenesis rises, the fraction of edits with **Φ₍DNA₎=1** shrinks and **L̂** rises; removing mutator pressure restores the curve.
  **Falsifier:** sustained **L≈0** with high mutator load and intact guards.

* **P2 (checkpoint step-down).** Variants that “pass” only with checkpoint blockers fail or show **L>0** when blockers are withdrawn.
  **Falsifier:** blocker-dependent variants that keep **L=0** after full step-down with intact floors.

* **P3 (immune mix).** Edits acceptable in immune-naive culture but not in immune-competent co-culture are pruned (i(v) sets the min); certified isolation reverses pruning.
  **Falsifier:** cross-context persistence with **L=0** and verified ε≈0 isolation having been unnecessary.

---

#### G) Operator checklist (one page, runnable in labs)

1. **Pair design:** control vs hypermutator background.
2. **Introduce v-libraries;** quantify r/q/a/i proxies per §4.1; compute **Φ̂₍DNA₎** with bands.
3. **Run step-down:** remove checkpoint/immune masks; log **L̂** and floor markers.
4. **Mix contexts:** immune co-culture/orthogonal niches; use **inf** across contexts unless isolation ε is certified.
5. **Decide:** δ(v)=1 only if **Φₗ=1** and floors pass; otherwise redesign (safer edit, isolation, rollback) or abstain.

**Takeaway.** Hypermutation and guard pathways don’t merely *influence* outcomes—they instantiate the stacked-veto form: whenever r/q/a/i veto, you observe positive upkeep **now**. Only when all clearances and relevant floors are at 1 do you get **Φ=1 ⇔ L=0**, i.e., the biological mirror of “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”

## 7.2 Deep mutational scanning for conservation fixed-points

**Purpose.** Use deep mutational scanning (DMS) to probe whether ultra-conserved loci behave as **fixed points** of the stacked-veto selector: most nearby variants show **Φ₍DNA₎(v)<Θ**, with only a razor-thin plateau at **Φ₍DNA₎=1** and **L(v)=0** under step-down.

---

#### A) Design (one locus, many variants)

* **Target sets.** Choose loci with prior conservation signals (coding or regulatory). Construct libraries covering single substitutions ± small indels: **V={v₁,…,v\_M}** around each target.
* **Contexts.** Evaluate each v across niches **k=1…K** (cell types, stressors). Compute **Φ₍DNA₎^k(v)=min{r,q, a,i, e}** per §4.1; organismal **Φ₍DNA₎^org(v)=min\_k Φ₍DNA₎^k(v)** unless certified isolation is part of the proposal.
* **Assays.** Parallel measurement of r/q/a/i/e proxies (replication fidelity, checkpoint passage, apoptosis/senescence, immune recognition, microenvironment compatibility). Include **step-down** runs (remove masks, inhibitors, supplements) to expose hidden load.

---

#### B) Scoring to Φ and δ

* **Layer bands.** For each v,k, report **r̂, q̂, â, î, ê** with intervals; derive **\[Φₗ^k(v), Φᵤ^k(v)]** by min on bounds; then **\[Φₗ^org(v), Φᵤ^org(v)] = \[min\_k Φₗ^k, min\_k Φᵤ^k]**.
* **Floors.** Add group floors **Gᵍ(v) ∈ {0,1}** (tissue integrity, immune competence, organismal viability) and fold in via \**Φ* = min(Φ, minᵍ Gᵍ)\*\*.
* **Decision labels.** At Θ=1:

  * **ADMIT:** Φₗ^org(v)=1 (within ε) and floors pass; **L→0** on step-down.
  * **PRUNE:** otherwise; or any floor=0; or **L>0** persists after step-down.

---

#### C) Analytic signatures of fixed points

* **Left-skewed Φ histogram.** For each locus, histogram **Φ₍DNA₎^org(v)** across V. **Prediction:** heavy mass below Θ, sparse mass at 1.
* **Cliff geometry.** Order variants by Hamming distance or biophysical perturbation; plot **ΔΦ** vs perturbation. **Prediction:** steep drop (“cliff”) near the reference sequence.
* **Persistence linkage.** Track barcode frequencies over time. **Prediction:** long-term persistence only for **Φ=1** calls; **Φ<1** lines require props (↑L̂) or decay after step-down.
* **Context infimum.** Compare best-context Φ to pooled **min\_k**. **Prediction:** many v acceptable somewhere but pruned by the worst context; isolation (if certified) reverses that only for the isolated branch.

---

#### D) Controls and step-down

* **Guard-intact vs masked.** Repeat DMS under checkpoint/immune suppression and then **withdraw** masks. **Prediction:** “rescued” low-Φ variants collapse or show **L̂>0** post step-down; only legitimately safe redesigns keep **L→0**.
* **Shuffled frames.** Re-name, re-order, re-label proposals; verify **h(v)** stable and **Φ̂** invariant (frame-invariance audit).

---

#### E) Quantities to report

* **Admissible fraction curve.** Fraction **|{v: Φₗ^org(v)≥Θ}|/|V|** vs Θ (Θ-sweep). Expect monotone contraction toward the all-clear set as Θ→1.
* **Load correlation.** Correlate Φ with load proxies after step-down: expect **Φ↗ ⇒ L̂↘**, with **L̂→0** only at **Φ=1** (§3.4).
* **Floor hits.** Rate of **Gᵍ=0** by variant class (e.g., structural vs regulatory) and its effect on Φ\*.
* **Uncertainty bands.** For each v, publish **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]** and the **min-controlling layer** (which of r,q,a,i,e or a floor set the bottleneck).

---

#### F) Falsifiers (what would undermine fixed-point behavior)

* **Broad neutrality.** Many v with **Φ₍DNA₎^org≈1** and **L→0** near an ultra-conserved core.
* **Masking that survives step-down.** Variants needing guard suppression that nonetheless show **L=0** and intact floors when props are removed.
* **Context averaging wins.** Pooled evaluation that legitimately raises Φ above the worst context **without** certified isolation and ε≈0.
* **Quiet floor breaches.** Sustained **L=0** despite documented **Gᵍ=0**.

Any of these would force revising the layer set, floor predicates, or the claim that these loci are selector fixed points.

---

#### G) Micro-workflow (operator checklist)

1. Build V; barcode and express in guard-intact lines.
2. Measure r/q/a/i/e per context; compute **Φ̂** bands and **Φ\*̂** with floors.
3. Run **step-down** (remove masks/supplements); re-measure Φ and **L̂**.
4. Track persistence (frequency trajectories) with and without props.
5. Output: Θ-sweeps, Φ histograms, load correlations, floor tables, invariance audits, and δ labels per v.

---

#### H) Example readouts (concise)

* **Fixed-point locus:** 92% of variants have **Φₗ^org<0.9**; 3% reach **Φₗ=1**; only those 3% persist with **L→0** after step-down.
* **Context-mix pruning:** 20% show **Φ≈1** in niche A but **Φ<0.8** in B; pooled infimum prunes them; certified isolation to A (ε≤0.01) restores δ=1 for that branch only.
* **Masking exposure:** Checkpoint-blocked runs show apparent Φ gains for 15% of variants; after step-down, all revert (Φ falls; **L̂↑**), confirming illegitimacy.

---

**Takeaway.** DMS at conserved sites should reveal **selector fixed points**: a narrow all-clear set with **Φ=1 ⇔ L=0**, surrounded by steep veto cliffs where at least one layer (r/q/a/i/e) or a floor fails. Where the data don’t show that, the DNA instantiation—and not the law—must be revised.

## 7.3 Context-mix competitions and predicted pruning

**Purpose.** Show that variants acceptable in one niche but not another are **pruned** when niches are mixed—unless strict isolation (ε≈0) is certified. This operationalizes the **inf-over-contexts** rule: **Φ₍DNA₎^org(v) = minₖ Φ₍DNA₎^k(v)**.

---

#### A) Setup: niches, leakage, and floors

* **Niches.** Choose two or more contexts (A, B, …) with distinct constraints (e.g., immune-competent vs immune-naïve; hypoxic vs normoxic; epithelial vs stromal).
* **Per-niche scores.** Measure **Φ₍DNA₎^A(v), Φ₍DNA₎^B(v)** from r, q, a, i, e (§4.1). Assume a focal case: **Φ^A(v)≈1**, **Φ^B(v)<Θ**.
* **Leakage ε.** Define the **mixing/escape rate** ε ∈ \[0,1] from A→B (or cross-contact intensity). ε is audited (tracers, barcodes, pore-calibrated barriers).
* **Floors.** Monitor **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ**, **Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ**, **Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ**, **Gᵒʳᵍ**. Floor breaches dominate selection even if cell-local fitness rises.

---

#### B) Competition designs (three canonical mixes)

1. **Mosaic co-culture (spatial mix).**

   * Pattern A-cells (v present) and B-cells (v absent) in checkerboards or organoid mosaics; tune ε by barrier porosity and motility inhibitors.
   * Readouts: f\_v(t) (variant frequency), barrier integrity, hypoxia/crowding, immune killing rates.

2. **Alternating environments (temporal mix).**

   * Cycle media/stressors between A-like and B-like conditions with period τ.
   * Readouts: survival over cycles; checkpoint/immune activation pulses; cumulative **L̂**.

3. **Shared-resource bi-compartment (coupled mix).**

   * Two chambers (A,B) exchange diffusible factors at rate κ while cells remain mostly in place; leakage ε may be ≪ κ.
   * Readouts: paracrine disruption, resource drains, **Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ** status, f\_v(t) in A.

---

#### C) Predicted regimes (as ε, κ vary)

Let **Φ^A(v)=1**, **Φ^B(v)<Θ**.

* **R1 Hard prune (ε>0, any κ).**
  Any nonzero engagement with B exposes v to its veto: **Φ\_mix(v)=min(Φ^A, Φ^B)=Φ^B<Θ** ⇒ **pruning**. Expect f\_v↓ over time or a floor trip with **L̂↑** (immune attack, barrier loss).

* **R2 Floor-mediated prune (ε≈0, κ>0).**
  Even with negligible cell leakage, cross-talk (κ) can violate floors in B or globally (e.g., angiogenic hijack, cytokine storms), flipping **Gᵍ=0** and forcing **Φ*<Θ*\*. Expect L̂↑ and floor alarms despite low ε.

* **R3 Certified isolation survival (ε≤ε\*, κ≈0, floors pass).**
  If isolation is **proven** (ε near zero, minimal cross-talk, floors intact), evaluate v on **A only**: **Φ\_mix=Φ^A=1** ⇒ persistence allowed. Receipts must log isolation proofs and ongoing leakage tests.

* **R4 Temporal tolerance vs veto (τ).**
  If τ exposes v to B long enough to trigger q/a/i responses, effective Φ drops to **Φ^B**; rapid alternation that *truly* prevents B-specific triggers can behave like isolation (must be proven, not claimed).

---

#### D) Minimal dynamics (intuition)

Let f\_v(t) be v’s share. In mixes, v’s effective growth is penalized by B’s veto pressure λ\_B>0 (checkpoint arrest, immune clearance, resource shortfall):

* **df\_v/dt ≈ f\_v (w\_A − w̄) − ε·λ\_B·f\_v − 𝟙\[floors fail]·Ω,**
  where Ω captures abrupt loss under a floor trip. Thus any ε>0 or floor breach drives f\_v↓ unless isolation is real. Rising **L̂** (repair/immune/institutional load) accompanies positive penalties.

---

#### E) Assays and metrics (what to measure)

* **Frequency & fitness.** f\_v(t), relative growth in A, B, and mixed setups.
* **Layer proxies.** Per-context r/q/a/i/e; show which sets the **min** for Φ.
* **Load proxies.** Repair signaling, arrest/apoptosis fractions, immune cytotoxicity, surveillance intensity, compliance scaffolds.
* **Floors.** Barrier integrity, resource saturation, systemic immune competence.
* **Isolation audits.** Tracer leakage ≤ ε\*; cross-talk bound κ\*; periodic **step-down** of props to verify **L→0** only in true admits.

---

#### F) Expected empirical signatures

* **Selective decline or clearance** of v in mixed contexts with ε>0 (or κ that trips floors).
* **Load spike** during attempted persistence (Lᵐᵃᵗ/Lᶦⁿᶠ/Lⁱⁿˢ↑).
* **Floor alarms** (Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ=0, Gʳᵉˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ=0, or Gᶦᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ=0) preceding or accompanying f\_v collapse.
* **Receipt outcome:** **δ(v)=0 at Θ=1** for mixes unless isolation is certified and floors pass.

---

#### G) Falsifiers (what would overturn pruning claims)

* **Sustained persistence** of v in mixed contexts with **ε>0** or significant κ, **and**
  (i) **L≈0** after step-down of compensations, **and**
  (ii) **all floors remain 1**.
* **Context averaging win:** pooled evaluation raising Φ above min{Φ^A,Φ^B} without certified individualized assignment/isolation.
* **Isolation sham:** certified ε≤ε\* later fails tracer audits while v still persists without L̂↑.

Any such result demands revising the layer set, floor modeling, or the min-over-contexts rule.

---

#### H) Operator checklist (one page)

1. **Choose v** with Φ^A≈1, Φ^B<Θ.
2. **Run mixes** (mosaic, alternating, coupled) with controlled ε, κ.
3. **Quantify** f\_v(t), layer proxies, L̂, and floors.
4. **Audit isolation** (tracers) and cross-talk; log ε, κ in receipts.
5. **Decision:** at Θ=1, **δ=0** for any mix unless **ε≤ε\*** and floors pass; otherwise redesign (tighter isolation, rollback) or abstain.
6. **Step-down** props; persistence with **L→0** is the only admissible survival.

---

**Takeaway.** Mixing contexts exposes the **worst** niche—by design. Unless leakage and cross-talk are **truly** near zero and floors are intact, variants that are pruned in any context will be pruned in the mix. This is the biological face of the universal rule: **disjunction without individualized guarantees collapses to the minimum; only certified isolation lets an acceptable branch stand.**

## 7.4 Social/AI pilots: mechanisms to approach unanimity without coercion

**Purpose.** Give concrete, non-coercive ways to redesign proposals **s** so valid vetoes flip to acceptance (Aᵢ:0→1), legitimately increasing **Φ(s)** while respecting Θ=1 at law level. Pilots are instruments to **change s**, not to pressure people.

---

#### A) Pilot architecture (how to run, not to force)

* **Levels (from §5.2).**
  **S1** shadow (no user impact) → **S2** opt-in micro-pilot (isolation, caps) → **S3** limited release (bounded scope, kill-switch).
* **Individualized gating.** Treat personalization as **disjunction with certified individualized choice**: each person i gets an acceptable branch **sᵢ** (Φᵢ=1) or defaults to ¬s. No lotteries without guarantees.
* **Isolation & caps.** Log leakage ε≤ε\*; caps on N\*, T\*, R\*; any breach auto-rollback πʳ.
* **Reversibility first.** Tested rollback **πʳ** with pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ bounds in the receipt.
* **Floors at social scale.** Rights, due process, non-discrimination, data-protection, and institutional integrity as **Gᵍ(s)**; floors compose by **min** with Φ (no trade-offs).

---

#### B) Mechanisms that *legitimately* raise Φ (change s)

1. **Disclosure & comprehension.** Plain-language spec, explainer UIs, Q\&A windows, test-of-understanding receipts.
2. **Compensation & insurance.** Targeted benefits and enforceable coverage; escrowed remedies; published adjudicators (maps to §5.3).
3. **Menus (individualized disjunction).** Users choose among {s¹, s²,…, ¬s}; proof of assignment in receipts.
4. **Opt-in by default; revocation easy.** One-click off reverts along πʳ with bounded tᵣ, cᵣ.
5. **Privacy by construction.** Minimal collection, local/federated processing, data expiry; revocation deletes residuals—**content change** that can flip Aᵢ to 1.
6. **Safety & fairness as floors.** Enforce Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ, Gⁿᵒⁿᵈⁱˢᶜʳⁱᵐⁱⁿᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ, Gᵈᵘᵉᵖʳᵒᶜᵉˢˢ; violations set Φ\*<1 regardless of averages.
7. **Step-down tests.** Remove pressure/props regularly; Φ must not depend on manufactured consent; **L̂** must trend to 0.
8. **Receipts & ledger.** Material-equivalence hash h(s), min-decomposition, floors, PUW (if Θ<1), rollback drills (from §5.5).

**Prohibited “shortcuts”.** Countdown pressure, essential-needs leverage, dark patterns, scope slicing (“affected only”), context averaging, silent Θ drift.

---

#### C) AI-specific patterns (deployment without coercion)

* **S1 shadow mode.** Run models in parallel, produce **Φ̂** evidence and floor checks with **δ=0**.
* **Feature flags / staged rollout.** Config-gated, per-user **δᵢ**, instant rollback πʳ.
* **Bandits with guarantees.** Explore **only** inside the user-accepted menu; regret is measured within each person’s acceptable set.
* **Ranker disclosure & recourse.** “Why this?” + controls that change s (filters, blocks) so users can achieve Aᵢ=1.
* **Fairness floors.** Pre-declared constraints as **Gᵍ** (e.g., equalized error bounds); violations prune releases.
* **Data floors.** Gᵈᵖ: consented use, minimal retention, DP/federated proofs; any breach sets Φ\*<1.
* **Content safety.** Safety filters are part of s; audits prove they don’t manufacture consent (no chilling of dissent channels).

---

#### D) Evidence integration during pilots (raising Φ the right way)

* **From S1→S2.** Show that redesigns (menus, privacy, insurance) convert listed objections to acceptances; attach contracts and isolation audits; **Φₗ** rises.
* **From S2→S3 or Θ=1.** Demonstrate: floors pass; **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]→\[1,1]** within ε; **L̂→0** on step-down; rollback drills meet pᵣ/cᵣ/tᵣ.

---

#### E) Metrics & alarms (run-time)

* **Φ̂ bands** and min-controlling components (per path/context/floor).
* **Opt-in, opt-out, reversion latency tᵣ, rollback success.**
* **Load indicators L̂:** moderation load, support tickets, complaints, enforcement headcount.
* **Floor monitors:** rights incidents, bias deltas, due-process defects, privacy violations.
* **Isolation ε & cross-talk.** Leakage tests on schedule.
* **Θ hygiene.** PUW present for any Θ<1; zero silent drift.

Auto-exit when Φₗ<Θ, floors flip, πʳ degrades, or leakage/bias exceeds caps.

---

#### F) Micro-examples

1. **Recommender redesign.** Menu of rankers (chronological, friends-first, “serendipity”), opt-in ads with revenue-share, privacy floor (no cross-app tracking). Prior vetoes (privacy, control) flip; **Φ̂** rises; **L̂** falls on step-down; graduate to Θ=1.
2. **City curb-pricing.** Opt-in delivery windows, rebates, medical waivers, hard caps, 90-day rollback; transparent receipts. Uncompensated vetoes remain ⇒ keep S2; only move when **Φₗ=1** and rights floors pass.
3. **AI hiring screen.** Shadow evaluation, then candidate-opt-in review tool; fairness floors enforced; full appeal/record access. If any group floor fails → **δ=0**.

---

#### G) Falsifiers (what would indict a “pilot”)

* Φ̂ rises **only** under pressure; step-down drops Φ̂ or spikes **L̂**.
* Personalized menus missing (lottery laundering); users can’t actually secure an acceptable branch.
* Floors (rights, nondiscrimination, privacy) breached while δ=1 continues.
* Rollback drills fail pᵣ/cᵣ/tᵣ; Θ changed off-ledger.
  Any of these forces **EXIT**, redesign, and ledger disclosure.

---

#### H) Operator checklist (one screen)

* Define s and h(s); publish floors Gᵍ and caps; pick S1/S2/S3.
* Prove πʳ (pᵣ,cᵣ,tᵣ); certify isolation ε; issue PUW if Θ<1.
* Offer menus, compensation/insurance, privacy guarantees; log contracts.
* Compute **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** with min-composition; name the min step.
* Run step-down and red-team tests; watch **L̂** and floors.
* Admit at Θ=1 **only** when Φₗ=1 and floors=1; else keep reversible or abstain.

**Takeaway.** Social/AI pilots are not a license to act under uncertainty; they are a disciplined way to **change the proposal** so unanimous acceptability becomes real—without coercion, with receipts, and with the brakes always within reach.

## 7.5 Disconfirmers that would refute TST’s claims or Φ-instantiations

**Purpose.** Fix clear, testable conditions whose satisfaction would undermine (i) the TST kernel (Φ, δ, L, composition), or (ii) our DNA/social instantiations. Each item states *what would count*, *how to check* (step-down, floors, receipts), and *what it refutes*.

---

#### A) Law-level and load link (core claims)

1. **Stable living contradiction.**
   *What would count:* ∃ state s with a verified veto (**∃i, Aᵢ(s)=0**), yet after full **step-down** of props/coercion and with floors verified, the system runs indefinitely with **L(s)=0**.
   *Refutes:* §2.5 Immediate Non-Contradiction Lemma and §3.4 equivalence (A⇔Φ=1⇔L=0).

2. **Costless suppression.**
   *What would count:* A reproducible class of s where dissent is neutralized at zero ongoing cost and zero rights/floor impact (not merely hidden).
   *Refutes:* The “veto ⇒ positive maintenance” direction of §3.4.

---

#### B) Φ field and δ-gate (selector correctness)

3. **Φ=1 with a live veto.**
   *What would count:* A protocol-independent evaluation yielding **Φ(s)=1** while some **Aᵢ(s)=0** stands after non-manufacture audits.
   *Refutes:* Φ’s unanimity correspondence (§3.2 N2–N3).

4. **Coercion raises Φ.**
   *What would count:* Verified coercion/opacity increases Φ̂(s) and the increase *survives* step-down (no drop in Φ̂, no rise in L̂).
   *Refutes:* Adversary resistance (§3.2 A2) and §5.3 legitimacy criteria.

5. **Monotonicity failure.**
   *What would count:* Adding content (∧ or ∘) yields **Φ(s∧t) > Φ(s)** or **Φ(path) > min(steps)**.
   *Refutes:* §3.2 M1–M3 and composition safety.

6. **Disjunction without guarantees raises Φ.**
   *What would count:* For s ∨ t with no certified individualized choice, **Φ(s∨t) > min(Φ(s), Φ(t))**.
   *Refutes:* §3.2 M5 and anti-lottery laundering.

7. **Frame invariance break.**
   *What would count:* Two materially equivalent frames with the same **h(s)** but different Φ̂ beyond tolerance.
   *Refutes:* §3.2 A1 and §5.5 hashing/invariance.

---

#### C) Floors and scale composition

8. **Floors increasing admissibility.**
   *What would count:* Adding a legitimate group floor turns **Φ* = min(Φ, floors)*\* **up**, or a documented floor breach **Gᵍ=0** coexists with **L→0** after step-down.
   *Refutes:* §3.5 conservative floors and the link **Gᵍ=0 ⇒ L>0**.

9. **Group override of an individual veto.**
   *What would count:* A group integrity predicate setting some **Aᵢ** from 0→1 without changing s for that i.
   *Refutes:* No-substitution rule (§3.5).

---

#### D) Context and mixing

10. **Context averaging beats infimum.**
    *What would count:* Without certified isolation, pooled evaluation yields **Φ(s) > minₖ Φ(s|k)** and this persists with **L=0**.
    *Refutes:* Context rule (§3.2 M4; §7.3).

11. **Mixed-niche persistence without load.**
    *What would count:* A variant v with **Φ^A(v)=1**, **Φ^B(v)<Θ** persists in A∪B mixes with **ε>0** (or κ cross-talk) while **L≈0** and floors intact.
    *Refutes:* Context-mix pruning (§7.3).

---

#### E) DNA instantiation (Φ₍DNA₎ and floors)

12. **Low-Φ₍DNA₎, zero-load persistence.**
    *What would count:* A lineage with **Φ₍DNA₎(v)<1** (some layer r/q/a/i/e <1) that stably persists with **L(v)=0** after full step-down and intact guards.
    *Refutes:* §4.2–§4.4 stacked-veto necessity.

13. **Broad neutrality at ultra-conserved cores.**
    *What would count:* Many substitutions around a conserved locus show **Φ₍DNA₎≈1** with **L→0**, not just a razor plateau.
    *Refutes:* Conservation fixed-point claim (§4.4 B1).

14. **Masking that truly works.**
    *What would count:* Checkpoint/immune suppression “rescues” low-Φ variants that *still* have **L=0** after removing the mask, with organismal floors intact.
    *Refutes:* Adversary resistance at DNA scale (§4.3–§4.4 A3/F1).

15. **Floors irrelevant at organism scale.**
    *What would count:* Variants that violate **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ/Gᵒʳᵍ** yet produce long-run **L=0** and health under step-down.
    *Refutes:* Floor linkage (§4.3).

---

#### F) Social/AI pilots and governance

16. **Manufactured unanimity that passes step-down.**
    *What would count:* Apparent Aᵢ flips achieved via pressure/opacity remain even after pressure removal, with Φ̂ high and **L̂=0**.
    *Refutes:* Non-manufacture guard (§5.3) and load test.

17. **Silent Θ drift without harm signals.**
    *What would count:* Repeated δ=1 decisions at lowered Θ, off-ledger, that do not raise L̂ or trigger failures—and cannot be distinguished from Θ=1 admits by receipts/audits.
    *Refutes:* Ledger/receipt sufficiency (§5.5) and Θ hygiene (§3.3).

18. **Rollback mirage.**
    *What would count:* Certified πʳ repeatedly fails when invoked (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ out of bounds) yet protocols keep δ=1 active.
    *Refutes:* Reversibility discipline (§5.2–§6.3).

---

#### G) Evidence fusion and uncertainty

19. **Safe average beats min.**
    *What would count:* A vetted t-norm or average that **exceeds min** yet never masks a genuine veto in practice (no Type-I errors across audited cases).
    *Refutes:* Necessity (not just sufficiency) of min-style fusion (§6.2).

20. **Coverage failures at scale.**
    *What would count:* Systematic miscalibration where Φ ∉ \[Φₗ,Φᵤ] at rates above declared τ *without* triggering abstention/exits, producing Type-I admits.
    *Refutes:* Uncertainty handling (§6.2–§6.3).

---

#### H) What would *not* count (to avoid false refutation)

* **Short-run props.** Temporary stability with hidden enforcement or masks that fail step-down.
* **Frame changes.** Content-changing redesigns (new h(s)) producing different outcomes—this is redesign, not refutation.
* **Opportunity-cost complaints.** Delays (Type-II) do not refute unanimity or min-composition.

---

#### I) How refuters must be shown (receipt-grade)

* Publish material-equivalence hashes **h(s)** (or **v**), floor audits, coercion/pressure logs, step-down traces, and **L̂** series.
* Show persistence across time windows sufficient to rule out transient props.
* Register results on an append-only ledger so others can reproduce.

**Bottom line.** Any durable **Aᵢ=0 with L=0**, a **Φ or composition rule that admits without unanimity**, or **instantiation data where vetoes don’t create load after step-down** would directly undercut TST’s core or a specific Φ-instantiation. Short of that, failures motivate *redesigns* of instantiations—not abandonment of the universal law.


# 8. Philosophical Context and Canon

## 8.1 Kant: universalization vs consent-referential unanimity (why TST is stronger)

**Set-up.**

* **Kant (FUL):** “Act only on that maxim which you can at the same time will to be a universal law.” The test is **formalist**: take a maxim m, universalize it, check for contradiction in conception or in will.
* **TST (MECP):** “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.” The test is **consent-referential**: a proposal s is admissible iff **∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1**; in our kernel **Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0** and **δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s) ≥ Θ** with Θ=1 at law level.

---

#### A) What universalization gets right

* **Anti-exceptionalism.** No special pleading; a maxim must hold for all.
* **Structural contradiction check.** Some wrongs self-destruct when universalized (lying promises, theft economies).

**But:** the FUL’s quantifier ranges over **maxims** and a rational will’s counterfactual endorsement; it does **not** by itself encode the **actual unanimity of agents** now, nor the present-tense upkeep **L(s)** needed to hold a conflictual state together.

---

#### B) Where FUL underdetermines

1. **Multiplicity of compatible maxims.** Different universalizable framings can license incompatible actions; FUL alone lacks a tie-breaker.
2. **Silence on procedures.** FUL does not say how to decide under uncertainty, how to aggregate evidence, or how to detect manufactured consent.
3. **Temporal slippage.** “Could will as a law” is a modal, not an immediate stability test; it lacks the **L(s)>0** signal that a contradiction is being paid for now.
4. **Packaging tricks.** Without explicit composition rules, conjunctions, lotteries, or staged paths can appear harmless by clever maxim choice.

Kant’s other formulations (humanity as an end, kingdom of ends) help normatively, but they remain **programmatic** without an operational selector.

---

#### C) What TST adds (and fixes)

* **Consent semantics.** Admissible iff **∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1**; indifference counts as 1 (§2.2).
* **Scalar and gate.** **Φ(s) ∈ \[0,1]**, **δ(s)=1 iff Φ(s) ≥ Θ** with **Θ=1** as the law (§3.3).
* **Load link.** **Φ=1 ⇔ L=0** gives a **present-tense** falsifier of living contradictions (§3.4).
* **Composition safety.** Min-rules for conjunction, sequencing, and non-individualized disjunction; no lottery laundering (§3.1–§3.2).
* **Floors.** Scale constraints **Gᵍ(s)** add non-negotiable checks (rights, grid, ecology) without overriding any Aᵢ (§3.5).
* **Non-manipulability.** Timing and framing cannot raise Φ; manufactured consent is void (§3.6, §5.5).
* **Protocols.** Conservative intervals **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, abstention, reversibility, receipts, and ledgers (§5–§6).

Result: TST **operationalizes** the “kingdom of ends” ideal as a selection kernel that works now, under uncertainty, without averaging away a single dissent.

---

#### D) Why TST is stronger than bare universalization

1. **Quantifier on persons, not maxims.** FUL asks “could one will m as law?”; TST asks “do **all** agents endorse s?”—a strictly stronger bar.
2. **Immediate stability criterion.** If any valid veto exists, TST predicts **L(s)>0** now; FUL lacks this diagnostic.
3. **Compositional immunity.** TST forbids laundering via bundles, lotteries, or staged paths; FUL needs extra argument at each construction.
4. **Adversary resistance.** TST encodes anti-coercion, anti-framing, and auditability; FUL provides no receipt standard or tamper-evident governance.
5. **Scale-aware.** Group floors prevent “universalizable” yet system-breaking actions (e.g., grid or rights failures) from passing.
6. **Law/protocol separation.** TST keeps the **law** fixed (Θ=1, unanimity) and regulates only **how** we learn; FUL is silent on method.

---

#### E) Anticipated Kantian objections and replies

* **“Isn’t unanimity too strong?”**
  *Reply:* The law’s bar is Θ=1, but protocols allow **reversible pilots** under Θ<1 to *change s* (compensation, opt-in, guarantees) so real vetoes turn into real acceptances (§5.2–§5.3). No coercion, no drift.
* **“What about the Humanity Formula?”**
  *Reply:* TST’s consent semantics and anti-manufacture guard instantiate treating persons as ends: **Aᵢ(s)=1** under informed, uncoerced conditions or δ=0.
* **“Does unanimity collapse into veto tyranny?”**
  *Reply:* Only **valid** vetoes (surviving non-manufacture tests) count. TST requires redesign or individualized menus, not capitulation; floors block harmful “vetoes” that are in fact structural violations.

---

#### F) Micro-contrasts

* **Harmless deception to spare feelings.**

  * *FUL:* Often contested; some maxims appear universalizable.
  * *TST:* If even one agent would not accept deception under informed conditions, **Φ<1 ⇒ δ=0**; permissible only if a redesign (consent, expectations, opt-out) flips Aᵢ to 1.

* **“Fair” lottery for benefits with imposed risk.**

  * *FUL:* A “lotteries are permissible” maxim may be arguable.
  * *TST:* Without individualized opt-in or guarantees, **Φ(s∨t)=min**, so a single dissent prunes the lottery.

* **Emergency shortcuts.**

  * *FUL:* A maxim of exception may seem willable.
  * *TST:* “Emergency” must be **content-true** via floors; otherwise urgency is framing and cannot raise Φ (§3.6).

---

#### G) Synthesis

Kant’s universalization is an essential **normative intuition pump**; TST turns that intuition into a **decision-theoretic kernel** with unanimous consent, present-tense stability, conservative composition, and audited, non-manipulable procedures. In symbols:

**Kant (FUL):** modal will over maxims.
**TST (MECP):** **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i ∈ U, Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0**, with floors and protocols ensuring that this isn’t a slogan but a working law.

## 8.2 Social contract, rights, and minority protections implied by unanimity

**Claim.** If admissibility is **unanimity over U** (∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1), then a working social contract is not optional—it is the **infrastructure** that keeps consent possible. In practice this appears as **rights floors**, **minority protections**, and **institutional duties** that make Φ(s) evaluable without coercion or frame tricks.

---

#### A) From unanimity to rights floors

Define a composite rights predicate **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ(s) ∈ {0,1}** that encodes non-negotiable guarantees needed for informed, uncoerced assent (privacy, due process, non-discrimination, freedom of exit, etc.). Then:

* **Proposition 8.2.1 (necessity).** If **Φ(s)=1**, then **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ(s)=1**.
  *Reason:* if a rights guarantee fails for anyone, at least one Aᵢ(s)=0, so Φ(s)<1 (§3.4, §3.5).

* **Corollary (no trade-off).** Rights floors **compose by min** with Φ; they cannot be “balanced” away by benefits to others. Formally \**Φ*(s)=min(Φ(s), Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ(s), …)\*\*.

---

#### B) Minority protection—what “unanimity” actually buys

* **No majority override.** For any finite majority M and minority m, if **∃i ∈ m** with a **valid** veto (informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured), then **δ(s)=0** at Θ=1.
* **No veto tyranny.** Protocols test validity: misinformation/coercion do **not** create a standing Aᵢ=0 (§5.1, §5.3).
* **Constructive resolution.** The only lawful ways past a persistent veto are to **change s** (compensation, guarantees, isolation, menus) or to **abstain**.

---

#### C) Social-contract duties (institutional layer)

A society that aims to realize **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1** must maintain:

1. **Information & deliberation duty.** Plain-language disclosures, time to understand, representation for the absent; otherwise Aᵢ is undefined → **abstain** (§5.2).
2. **Exit & rollback duty.** A tested **πʳ** for any Θ<1 use; revocation must be feasible and low-cost (right to leave).
3. **Recourse & restitution duty.** Independent appeal, escrowed remedies, and due process before sanctions (§5.4).
4. **Non-manipulation duty.** Ban essential-needs leverage, dark patterns, synthetic scarcity; step-down tests to catch manufactured “assent” (§3.6, §5.5).
5. **Ledger duty.** Tamper-evident receipts and audits so Φ̂, floors, and δ are publicly reconstructible (§6.4).

These duties are **content** of the standing social contract **S**, so proposals are assessed as **s ⊕ S** by default.

---

#### D) Implied rights catalog (as floors)

Each item is a predicate inside **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ**; any 0 forces **Φ*<1*\*.

* **Bodily autonomy & integrity.** No nonconsensual intrusion; medical/ecological irreversibles set **Gᵇᵒᵈʸ=0** unless individualized assent and πʳ exist.
* **Due process & fair hearing.** Before punitive δ, publish the Π-trigger evidence and allow appeal; absence sets **Gᵈᵘᵉᵖʳᵒᶜᵉˢˢ=0** (§5.4).
* **Non-discrimination.** No branch whose benefits/harms hinge on protected traits; fairness constraints as **Gⁿᵈ=1** (§7.4).
* **Privacy & data agency.** Minimal collection, consented use, revocation/erasure; violations set **Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ=0**.
* **Freedom of expression/association.** Deliberation requires speech and organization; chilling effects set **Gᵉˣᵖ=0**.
* **Freedom to refuse (opt-out).** Defaults must not entrench participation; if **exit** is costly or blocked, **Gᵉˣⁱᵗ=0**.

---

#### E) How unanimity handles hard public goods

For proposals with externalities, unanimity **internalizes** costs rather than averaging dissent:

* **Compensation & insurance.** If i bears private cost, add **compᵢ** or insurance so **Aᵢ(s⊕compᵢ)=1** (§5.3).
* **Certified isolation.** If leakage ε can be made ≈ 0, evaluate per-branch: **Φ(s¹ ∨ s² …)=max** with individualized assignment (§3.2, §7.3).
* **Cap-and-consent.** Hard caps on impact + opt-in menus convert general imposition into individualized branches.

---

#### F) Children, impaired agents, and non-humans

Unanimity is over **U**. Where some members lack present-tense capacity:

* **Guardianship floors.** Substitute **Gᵍᵘᵃʳᵈ(s)=1** only if a guardian procedure (transparent, appealable, best-interest standards) stands in; it **adds** constraints, it does **not** lower any adult Aᵢ.
* **Agentless domains.** For non-agents (ecosystems, genomes) we use **floors** (carrying capacity, integrity) rather than pretending consent (§4, §3.5).

---

#### G) Formal consequences (compact)

* **Rights-floor necessity:** **Φ(s)=1 ⇒ Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ(s)=1**.
* **Minority protection:** **∃i, Aᵢ(s)=0 ⇒ δ(s)=0** at Θ=1.
* **Menus theorem:** If ∀i ∃ branch sᵢ with **Aᵢ(sᵢ)=1** and certified isolation, then **Φ(∨ᵢ sᵢ)=1** (evaluate by max with individualized choice).
* **Irreversibility bar:** If πʳ is impossible and **Hⁱʳʳ(s)>0**, then **δ(s)=0** unless **Φ(s)=1** within resolution (§6.3).

---

#### H) Practical checklist (policy designers)

* Publish **S**: disclosures, exits, recourse, privacy, fairness, ledger.
* Model floors and add them to **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ**; show **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ(s)=1**.
* Offer **menus**, compensation, and isolation proofs to convert vetos lawfully.
* Refuse **lotteries** and **bundles** without individualized guarantees.
* Require **receipts** and **rollback drills** for any Θ<1 phase.

---

**One-line takeaway.** Unanimity doesn’t just forbid coercion—it **implies** a social contract of rights, exits, recourse, and transparency that makes genuine consent feasible and protects minorities without giving majorities a license to overrule a single valid “no.”

## 8.3 Moral egoism vs universal law: why “all” cannot be scoped down

**Claim.** Any attempt to replace **all** with a proper subset—“me,” “my group,” “the affected,” “reasonable people,” “citizens,” “stakeholders,” etc.—is either (i) a **normative error** (changing the law), or (ii) a **manipulation** that produces a live veto outside the scope and thus positive upkeep **L>0** (§2.5, §3.4). Unanimity is taken over **U**, the universal class of agents (§2.1). Indifference counts as acceptance: **Aᵢ(s)=1** includes “I don’t mind” (§2.2). Therefore the “affected-only” carve-out is unnecessary and unsafe.

---

#### A) What moral egoism (and its disguises) does

* **Egoism (narrow S).** Evaluate admissibility using only a subset **S ⊊ U** (self, faction, payers, voters, “the affected,” “the reasonable”).
* **Symptoms.** Boundary-drawing (“not our remit”), externalities rebranded as *unaffected*, disenfranchisement, or “impact barring” (redefining harms as outside scope).
* **Protocol face.** It appears as silent Θ drift or scope slicing (forbidden by §5.1 and §5.5).

---

#### B) Minimal refutation (why scope-down fails)

* **Lemma 8.3.1 (Outside veto ⇒ load).** If a proposal **s** is evaluated on **S** with **∀j∈S, Aⱼ(s)=1**, but **∃i∈U∖S** with **Aᵢ(s)=0**, then by the Immediate Non-Contradiction Lemma (§2.3) **L(s)>0** whenever s is maintained.
  *Sketch.* The state simultaneously asserts “should” for S and “should-not” for i. That contradiction must be continuously paid for (enforcement, persuasion, guardrails), i.e., positive upkeep.
* **Corollary 8.3.2 (Subset unanimity ≠ admissibility).** **Φ\_S(s)=1** (unanimity on S) does **not** imply **Φ(s)=1**. Only **∀i∈U, Aᵢ(s)=1** yields **L(s)=0** (§3.4).

---

#### C) Why “affected-only” doesn’t help

* **Universal already includes the unaffected.** If someone is truly unaffected, **Aᵢ(s)=1** by indifference. No need to carve out; carving creates a manipulable boundary.
* **Hidden effects & future selves.** “Unaffected” often means “effects unmeasured or delayed”; context-mix (§7.3) and path composition (§3.1) bring them back.
* **Boundary gaming.** Scope line becomes the attack surface: redefine “affected,” change eligibility, or export harms. Our **material-equivalence** hashing (§5.5D) forbids such framing games; the law forbids the carve-out itself.

---

#### D) Formal contrasts (why TST dominates egoistic variants)

* **Egoist rule (ER):** δ(s)=1 iff **∀j∈S, Aⱼ(s)=1** for some S⊊U.
* **Universal law (MECP):** δ(s)=1 iff **∀i∈U, Aᵢ(s)=1**.
* **Dominance.** For any S⊊U there exist s with **Φ\_S(s)=1** and **Φ(s)<1**. Choosing ER thus admits states with **L>0** and violates §3.6 non-manipulability (who counts becomes content-free framing).

---

#### E) Micro-examples (diagnosing egoism)

1. **Shareholder-only optimization.** S = shareholders. Laid-off workers’ vetoes (U∖S) are “externalities.” Result: churn, surveillance, regulatory drag ⇒ **Lᶦⁿˢ/Lᶦⁿᶠ>0**; receipts would show Φ<1.
2. **“Affected-residents only” curfew.** Non-residents (gig workers, visitors) are excluded; yet some bear costs ⇒ **Aᵢ=0** outside S; policing load rises (**Lᵐᵃᵗ>0**).
3. **Data program with “opt-out if you notice.”** Treats the unaware as unaffected. Step-down (full disclosure) produces new vetoes ⇒ prior “consent” was manufactured; Φ was inflated.

---

#### F) Floors don’t license scope-down

Group floors **Gᵍ(s)** (rights, grid, ecology) **add** constraints; they **never** replace any **Aᵢ(s)** (§3.5). A rights floor can block admissibility; it cannot convert an excluded person’s **Aᵢ=0** to 1. No “group override.”

---

#### G) Relationship to mainstream views

* **Kantian universalization** tests maxims, not **actual** unanimity; TST strengthens it with consent semantics and present-tense load (§8.1).
* **Contractualism (“reasonable rejectability”)** approximates TST, but we avoid surrogate “representative” agents: we require **actual** **Aᵢ(s)=1** (with non-manufacture) or abstention.
* **Pareto language.** TST implies Pareto safety but is stricter: no “Kaldor-Hicks” compensations without **real** compensation that flips **Aᵢ** to 1 (§5.3).

---

#### H) Detection & prevention (operator checklist)

* **Scope audit.** Does any phrase limit “all” to **S**? (“affected,” “users,” “citizens,” “participants,” “shareholders”). Expand to **U**; map non-agents to **floors** (§4, §3.5).
* **Material-equivalence hash.** Ensure boundary labels do not change **h(s)**; if Φ̂ moves under relabeling, abort (§5.5D).
* **Non-manufacture test.** Remove pressures/disclosures; if new vetoes surface, earlier scope was masking dissent (§5.3, §3.6).
* **Receipts.** Must list how absent/quiet standpoints were represented (translations, time windows, proxies only where justified: guardianship floors in §8.2F).

---

#### I) Compact formal summary

* **Universal Domain Axiom:** quantifier ranges over **U** (§2.1).
* **Indifference rule:** **Aᵢ(s)=1** includes “unaffected/indifferent” (§2.2).
* **Scope-down theorem:** For any **S⊊U**, ∃s with **Φ\_S(s)=1** & **Φ(s)<1 ⇒ L(s)>0** (§2.5, §3.4).
* **No-substitution:** Floors cannot flip any **Aᵢ=0 → 1**; they only add vetoes (§3.5).

**One-line takeaway.** “All” means **all**—not “those we count,” “those we notice,” or “those we affect.” Any scoping down either changes the law or hides a veto that will surface as upkeep **L>0**. TST keeps the domain universal and closes the boundary games that moral egoism exploits.

## 8.4 Timeless vs timed orders; framing immunity; the role of non-contradiction

**Claim.** The law is **timeless**: admissibility depends on the **material content** of a proposal, not on when or how it is narrated. Timing matters **only** when it changes the world described. Framing (labels, countdowns, packaging) cannot convert a veto into acceptance. Whenever a proposal asserts “must” while any agent rightly asserts “must not,” we have a **living contradiction** that produces upkeep **now** (L>0).

---

#### A) Timeless law, timed descriptions

* **Timelessness.** “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all” evaluates **s** by **∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1**, regardless of calendar time.
* **Timed orders as content.** Write **s\@t** when timing **changes consequences** (e.g., “harvest after spawning” vs “harvest now”). Then **s\@t ≠ s\@t′** as content and must be evaluated separately.
* **Time-relabel invariance.** If timing does **not** change material consequences, **s\@t ≡ s\@t′**, so
  **Aᵢ(s\@t)=Aᵢ(s\@t′)**, **Φ(s\@t)=Φ(s\@t′)**, **L(s\@t)=L(s\@t′)**.

---

#### B) Framing immunity (hash the meaning, not the marketing)

* **Material-equivalence hash.** Proposals that are the same in content share **h(s)**; receipts must show **Φ̂** identical across frames with the same hash (§5.5).
* **Framing immunity lemma.** If two descriptions s, s′ have **h(s)=h(s′)** yet **Φ̂(s)≠Φ̂(s′)** beyond tolerance, the decision is invalid (manipulation or estimator error).
* **Anti-urgency rule.** “Now or never,” synthetic scarcity, and UI countdowns **do not** alter Aᵢ or Φ unless they encode genuine content (e.g., perishability, safety windows). Otherwise they only add **informational/institutional load** (part of L).

---

#### C) Non-contradiction as the present-tense test

* **Logical core.** If ∃i with **Aᵢ(s)=0**, the system is holding **A** (“this should happen”) and **¬A** (“this should not happen”) together.
* **Immediate load.** Such conflict is **self-maintaining work**—persuasion, surveillance, compliance scaffolds—so **L(s)>0** *now* (§2.5, §3.4).
* **Selector tie-in.** The kernel enforces: **Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0**, and **δ(s)=1** only if **Φ(s) ≥ Θ** (Θ=1 at law level). Timed theatrics cannot change this equivalence.

---

#### D) What counts as legitimate timing (content, not pressure)

* **Legitimate (contentful):** physical windows (launch windows, spawning cycles), safety cutoffs, grid stability intervals, legal notice periods—anything that **changes outcomes even under ideal information**. These create distinct proposals **s\@t** with their own Aᵢ/Φ/L.
* **Illegitimate (framing):** engineered countdowns, last-minute opacity, “agree before midnight or lose essentials,” bundling decisions to exhaust attention. These **do not** raise Φ; they inflate **L** and fail non-manufacture tests.

---

#### E) Composition defenses against time tricks

* **Path minimum.** Breaking s into timed micro-steps cannot launder inadmissibility: **Φ(path)=min over steps**; any vetoing step blocks δ at Θ=1.
* **Disjunction rule.** “Take it now or later” is **s\@t ∨ s\@t′**. Without **individualized choice** and proof that both branches are acceptable to each chooser, **Φ = min**, not an average.
* **Hysteresis (optional).** Θᵤ/Θₗ can prevent flapping, but **both** are logged; changing thresholds off-ledger is forbidden.

---

#### F) Tests operators must run

1. **Equivalence test.** Rephrase and re-time; compute **h(s)**. If hashes match, **Φ̂** must match within ε or δ aborts.
2. **Step-down of pressure.** Remove urgency banners, scarcity levers, and “act now” UI; **Φ̂** must not fall. A drop signals manufactured consent; revert.
3. **Timing-as-content audit.** For any claimed deadline, publish the causal graph showing what **materially** changes across t; otherwise treat timing as framing.

---

#### G) Micro-examples

* **Legit timing:** “Bridge lane closure 02:00–04:00” (low traffic, safety window). **s\@02:00** and **s\@14:00** differ in externalities; evaluate separately.
* **Illegit timing:** “Policy vote in 24 hours with 200-page appendix.” Content unchanged; Aᵢ undefined for many (no comprehension), Φ̂ falls under non-manufacture; **δ=0**.
* **Rollback window:** “Pilot runs for 30 days with guaranteed rollback πʳ.” That timing **is content** (adds reversibility), often flipping vetoes to acceptance; Φ may legitimately rise.

---

#### H) Compact formal summary

* **Time invariance:** If **s\@t ≡ s\@t′**, then **Aᵢ, Φ, L** are equal.
* **Framing immunity:** **h(s)=h(s′) ⇒ Φ̂(s)=Φ̂(s′)** (ε tolerance).
* **Non-contradiction:** **∃i Aᵢ=0 ⇒ L>0**; therefore no timed framing can lawfully convert **Φ<1** into **Φ=1**.
* **Admissibility:** **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1** (Θ=1), regardless of narration time; timing matters only as **content**.

**One-line takeaway.** The universe cares about **what** you do, not **when** you say it. Only timing that changes the world changes admissibility; all other timing is framing—and framing cannot defeat non-contradiction or raise Φ.

# 9. Governance and Implementation

## 9.1 AI controllers: δ-gate logic, abstention, rollback, and provenance

**Role.** An AI controller is a *selector*—not a judge, not a punisher. Its job is to (i) compute and guard **δ(s)** from **Φ̂(s)** with **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** and floors **Gᵍ(s)**, (ii) default to **abstention** unless unanimity is demonstrated, (iii) allow only **reversible** provisional use under a published warrant, and (iv) emit **receipts** to a tamper-evident ledger with full **provenance**.

---

#### A) Inputs, outputs, and invariants

* **Inputs.** Proposal **s**, material-equivalence hash **h(s)**; estimator **Φ̂(s)** with interval **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**; floors **{Gᵍ(s)}**; threshold regime **Θ** (and optional **Θᵤ/Θₗ**); disjunction mode; isolation leakage **ε**; rollback plan **πʳ = (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ)**; harm class and safety margin **m**; monitoring channels for **L̂** and floor sentinels.
* **Outputs.** Decision **δ(s) ∈ {0,1}**; status label (ADMITTED | PROVISIONAL | PRUNED | ABSTAINED | EXITED | ALERT); a signed **receipt** and ledger entry.
* **Non-negotiable invariants.**

  1. **Law bar:** at law level **Θ=1**, **δ=1 ⇔ Φ=1 ⇔ ∀i Aᵢ=1 ⇔ L=0** (within resolution ε).
  2. **Conservative fusion:** components/paths/contexts/floors aggregate by **min** (or a stricter declared t-norm T ≤ min).
  3. **Frame invariance:** if **h(s)=h(s′)** then **Φ̂(s)=Φ̂(s′)** within tolerance.
  4. **No averaging dissent;** no silent Θ drift; no coercion-based “Φ-gains”.

---

#### B) δ-gate logic (with hysteresis and margins)

Let **ε** be measurement tolerance and **m** the safety margin for the harm class (C1…C4 in §6.3).

* **Universal regime (Θ=1).**

  * **Admit:** if **Φₗ ≥ 1−ε+m** and **∀g, Gᵍ=1** → **δ=1 (ADMITTED)**.
  * **Else:** **δ=0**; label **PRUNED** if **Φᵤ<1−ε** or a floor is 0; else **ABSTAINED** with missing-evidence list.
* **Provisional regime (Θ<1, time-boxed).**

  * Require a **Provisional Use Warrant** with scope, **Θ**, **πʳ**, isolation ε bounds, monitoring, exit triggers.
  * **Enter PROVISIONAL:** if **Φₗ ≥ Θ+m**, floors verified, **πʳ** meets bounds (**pᵣ ≥ p\***, **cᵣ ≤ C\***, **tᵣ ≤ T\***).
  * **Auto-EXIT:** if any trigger fires (Φₗ<Θ, floor flip, **R(s)**>caps, **πʳ** degraded, invariance fail).
* **Hysteresis (optional).** Use **Θᵤ ≥ Θₗ** to prevent flapping: admit when **Φₗ ≥ Θᵤ**, keep while **Φₗ ≥ Θₗ**; log both.

**Individualized disjunction.** When s offers menus {s¹,…}, set per-person gate **δᵢ=1** iff that person’s chosen branch has **Φᵢ=1**; controller must enforce **max\_with\_individualized\_choice** mode (else default to **min**).

---

#### C) Controller state machine (operational)

States: **ABSTAINED → PROVISIONAL → ADMITTED → EXITED** (plus asynchronous **ALERT**).

* **ABSTAINED.** Default. Emit receipt with what would raise **Φₗ** (tests, guarantees).
* **PROVISIONAL (Θ<1).** Active only under a valid warrant; continuous monitoring; rollback armed.
* **ADMITTED (Θ=1).** All-clear within ε; periodic audits still required (invariance, floors, step-down).
* **ALERT (overlay).** Any sentinel breach; freeze escalations; may jump to **EXITED**.
* **EXITED.** πʳ executed; publish restitution and post-mortem; close warrant.

---

#### D) Minimal gate pseudocode (Unicode, side-effect free)

```
gate(s):
  assert invariance_ok(h(s))
  (Φ̂,[Φₗ,Φᵤ]) ← estimator(s)
  G ← floors(s)          # each ∈ {0,1} or [gₗ,gᵤ]
  Φₗ ← min(Φₗ, min_g gₗ); Φᵤ ← min(Φᵤ, min_g gᵤ)

  if Θ == 1:
    if Φₗ ≥ 1−ε+m and all G = 1:
      return δ=1, "ADMITTED"
    elif Φᵤ < 1−ε or any G = 0:
      return δ=0, "PRUNED"
    else:
      return δ=0, "ABSTAINED"

  else:  # Θ < 1, provisional
    require PUW(s) and rollback_ready(πʳ)
    if Φₗ ≥ Θ+m and all G = 1 and rollback_ready(πʳ):
      arm_monitors(); return δ=1, "PROVISIONAL"
    else:
      return δ=0, "ABSTAINED"
```

**Runtime monitor (sketch).**

```
monitor(s):
  while δ=1:
    update [Φₗ,Φᵤ], L̂, floors, πʳ_health
    if Φₗ < Θ or floor_flip or R(s) > caps or rollback_unhealthy or invariance_fail:
      execute πʳ; log EXIT; set δ=0; break
```

---

#### E) Provenance, receipts, and ledger hooks

Each decision emits a **receipt** (see §6.4): **h(s)**, regime (**Θ, Θᵤ/Θₗ**), **Φ̂** with **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, min-controlling step/component/context, floors table, composition proof, invariance tests, step-down logs, **πʳ** stats, isolation ε, and signatures.
All receipts are chained on a **hash-linked ledger**; no Θ change or model swap occurs off-ledger.

**Training/data provenance (AI-specific).** Log model id, dataset hashes, data-use floors (consent/DP), and evaluation suites. Violations set **Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ=0** → **δ=0**.

---

#### F) Placement of δ-gates (hierarchical control)

* **System-level δₛ.** Whole program / policy.
* **Feature-level δ\_f.** Each risky component (e.g., recommender, biometric).
* **Request-level δᵣ.** Per-user inferences/actions (enforce individualized disjunction).
  **Composition:** **δ\_total = min(δₛ, min\_f δ\_f, min\_requests δᵣ)**; Φ-estimates mirror this decomposition with explicit min proofs in the receipt.

---

#### G) What the controller must *refuse* to do

* **No punishment.** Controllers never sanction; they only refuse, log, or exit. Punishability (Π-trigger, culpability) is a human due-process lane (§5.4).
* **No scope slicing.** “Affected-only,” “users-only,” etc., are rejected as frame games; the domain is **U** (§8.3).
* **No coercive lifts.** Countdown banners, dark patterns, essential-needs leverage do not raise Φ; step-down is mandatory.
* **No averaging dissent.** Disallow any aggregator that exceeds **min** (unless a stricter t-norm is declared and logged).

---

#### H) Safety margins, classes, and rollback readiness

* **Harm classes C1–C4** (trivial→serious/irreversible) set **m**, caps on **R(s)**, and **πʳ** bounds (**pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ**).
* **Guardrails:** **C4** forbids Θ<1 entirely; **C3** demands tight caps and short windows; **C1–C2** allow small S2/S3 pilots with kill-switches.
* **Rollback drills:** periodic, surprise; failures freeze the class and force EXIT.

---

#### I) Metrics & alarms (always-on)

* **Invariance score** (frames with |ΔΦ̂|=0).
* **Composition compliance** (min-step correctly identified).
* **Load trend L̂** (material/informational/institutional).
* **Rollback health** (success rate, median **tᵣ**, **cᵣ**).
* **Abstention rate** (should not collapse without evidence).
* **Θ hygiene** (every Θ<1 has a valid PUW).
  Breaches raise **ALERT** and may auto-EXIT.

---

#### J) Operator checklist (one screen)

* Compute **h(s)**; run frame-invariance suite.
* Assemble **Φ̂** with **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** using min-composition across parts, paths, contexts, floors.
* Select regime (**Θ=1** by default; otherwise issue PUW).
* Verify **πʳ** (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ) and isolation ε if claimed.
* Run red-team tests (lotteries, bundles, time tricks, context averaging).
* Call **gate(s)**; emit receipt; append to ledger.
* If **δ=1** and **Θ<1**: start **monitor(s)**; arm exits; schedule step-down.
* Never punish. Escalate sanctions only via human Π-lane with due process.

---

**One-line takeaway.** An AI controller is a conservative switch: it *admits only unanimity*, *refuses under uncertainty*, *exits the moment reality disagrees*, and leaves an auditable trail that proves every δ was faithful to **“Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”**

## 9.2 Institutional design: charters, group floors, review boards, appeals

**Objective.** Build institutions that keep δ-decisions faithful to **unanimity over U** while operating under uncertainty: a charter that fixes invariants, registries for **group floors Gᵍ**, independent review boards that issue/deny δ with receipts, and an appeal lane for sanctions (Π) and errors.

---

#### A) The Charter (constitutional layer)

**Purpose.** Freeze what cannot drift; publish what can.

**Must fix (non-negotiables).**

* **Law bar:** Θ=1 at law level; **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0** (ε resolution).
* **Aggregation:** min (or stricter declared t-norm **T ≤ min**) across parts/paths/contexts/floors.
* **Domain:** quantifier over **U**; no scope slicing.
* **Framing immunity:** **h(s)=h(s′) ⇒ Φ̂(s)=Φ̂(s′)** within ε.
* **No averaging dissent;** no manufactured consent; timed framing has no force (8.4).

**Must publish (policy knobs).**

* **Harm classes (C1–C4)** and safety margins **m(C)**.
* **PUW policy** (when Θ<1 allowed), rollback bounds **πʳ=(pᵣ,cᵣ,tᵣ)**, leakage cap **ε\***, monitoring cadence.
* **Punishability threshold Π** and due-process standards (§5.4).
* **Receipt schema and ledger interface** (6.4).
* **Red-team program** and bounty rules (6.5).

---

#### B) Floor Registries & Custodians (scale integrity)

Create a **Floor Registry** with named predicates and owning custodians:

* **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ** (rights/due process/privacy). Custodian: Rights Office.
* **Gᵍʳⁱᵈ** (critical infrastructure & safety). Custodian: Grid Safety.
* **Gᵉᶜᵒˡ** (ecology/carrying capacity). Custodian: Ecology Board.
* **Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ** (data consent/DP/fair use). Custodian: Data Steward.
* **Gᵒʳᵍ / Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ** (biomedical contexts). Custodian: Bio-Integrity.

**Duties.** Define tests, publish protocols, certify/deny **Gᵍ(s)=1**, run stress drills, and file floor receipts. Floors **add** constraints and never replace any **Aᵢ**.

---

#### C) Review Boards (δ-issuers) & Process

**Boards.** Independent **Selector Boards (SBs)** for domains (civic, AI, bio, infra). Mixed membership (experts + laypersons by sortition), rotating terms, strict conflict rules.

**Pipeline (every proposal s).**

1. **Intake.** Normalize to canonical form; compute **h(s)**.
2. **Evidence assembly.** Φ̂ with **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, composition proof, contexts, floors; attach contracts (compensation/insurance), isolation proofs, πʳ.
3. **Floor certifications.** Custodians file pass/fail receipts.
4. **Gate.** Apply §9.1 δ-logic with margins/hysteresis.
5. **Receipt.** Emit signed decision (ADMITTED/PROVISIONAL/PRUNED/ABSTAINED), publish to ledger.
6. **Monitoring (if Θ<1).** Start live band tracking, step-downs, exit triggers.

**Guards.** Open meetings by default; minority reports logged; red-team seat with veto on process violations.

---

#### D) Appeals & Remedies (separate lane)

**When.** (i) Contested δ; (ii) alleged Θ/receipt violations; (iii) sanctions (Π lane).

**Bodies.** Independent **Appeals Tribunal** (AT) with power to:

* **Stay** punishments automatically pending review.
* **Vacate** δ and order **EXIT** if charter breaches found.
* **Order restitution** and recalibration of Φ̂ when non-manufacture or floor errors are proven.

**Standards.**

* **For δ errors:** show receipt defect (hash, min-step, floor audit, invariance, or πʳ).
* **For punishability:** require **Γₗ≥Π** **and** culpability (knowledge, alternatives, voluntariness, fair-notice).
  All appeal packets become **APPEAL** entries on the ledger.

---

#### E) Ledger Authority & Transparency

A neutral **Ledger Authority (LA)** operates the append-only log:

* **Enforces** schema, hashes, prev\_hash links, and signature checks.
* **Publishes** queryable views: active PUWs, Θ changes, floor failures, exits, red-team findings.
* **Privacy guardrails:** store proofs/ids, minimize PII, log redactions.

---

#### F) Capture-Resistance & Ethics

* **Independence:** budget firewall; incompatibilities (no board member may be vendor/regulator of the same s); cooling-off periods.
* **Rotation & sortition:** staggered terms; random lay seats.
* **Recusal:** mandatory for conflicts; public register.
* **Whistleblower safe harbor** and bounty for protocol breaches.
* **Metrics dashboard:** invariance score, abstention rate, PUW hygiene, rollback health, floor pass rates—auto-ALERT on drift.

---

#### G) Emergency & PUW Governance

* **No “emergency” framing.** Only content-true floors (e.g., imminent grid collapse) justify provisional Θ<1.
* **PUW contents:** scope, **Θ**, caps, πʳ, isolation ε, monitoring, exit triggers, operators.
* **Auto-EXIT:** on Φₗ<Θ, floor flip, **R(s)**>caps, πʳ degrade, or invariance fail.
* **Sunset & renewal:** PUWs expire; renewals require fresh evidence and drills.

---

#### H) Small vs. large deployments (profiles)

* **Lightweight (org scale).** One SB, shared Floor Custodian, external LA; monthly red-team; PUWs ≤ 30 days.
* **Civic/national.** Multiple SBs, independent custodians, public LA; statutory rights floors; standing AT; quarterly stress tests and public reports.

---

#### I) Failure modes → countermeasures

* **Silent Θ drift →** LA blocks entries; SB discipline; public ALERT.
* **Framing games →** invariance audits; h(s) mismatch forces re-intake.
* **Lottery laundering →** composition proof must show min; individualized choice or reject.
* **Paper rollback →** surprise drills; failures freeze the class and revoke PUWs.
* **Floor laxity →** custodians audited; failing custodian triggers external review.

---

#### J) Charter clauses (concise template)

1. **Invariants.** Law bar, domain U, aggregation T, framing immunity.
2. **Evidence.** Classes (empirical/legal/historical/normative), interval bands **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, receipts.
3. **Floors.** Registry, custodians, test protocols, composition by min.
4. **Decisions.** δ-logic, statuses, PUW terms, exit triggers.
5. **Appeals.** Standards, stays, remedies, publication.
6. **Ledger.** Authority, schema, access, privacy.
7. **Red-team.** Scope, cadence, bounties, non-retaliation.
8. **Ethics.** Conflicts, rotation, whistleblower protections.

---

**One-line takeaway.** Put unanimity into institutions: a charter that fixes the invariants, floor custodians that guard scale integrity, independent boards that issue δ with receipts, a ledger that makes it all tamper-evident, and an appeals lane that corrects mistakes without coercion—so no one can pass off a living contradiction as law.

## 9.3 Datasets, benchmarks, and open tools for Φ-estimation

**Goal.** Make Φ-estimation testable and reproducible. We define open **tracks**, **schemas**, **benchmarks**, and **tools** so any lab or institution can show that its estimates, intervals, and δ-decisions obey the law (unanimity over U), floors, and composition rules.

---

#### A) Tracks (what to build first)

* **DNA-ΦBench.** Deep mutational scans, context-mix assays, floor tests (tissue/organism integrity), and **step-down** logs (guards removed).
* **AI/Social-ΦBench.** Opt-in pilots with receipts: deliberation artifacts, compensation/insurance contracts, **menus** (individualized branches), isolation ε audits, fairness/rights floors, rollback drills.
* **Controller-ΦBench.** Black-box δ-gate evaluation: feeds proposals and frames, checks invariance, min-composition, PUW hygiene, and auto-exit behavior.

---

#### B) Minimal record schemas (portable, auditable)

**Proposal record (common).**

```json
{
  "id":"…", "h":"h(s)", "summary":"…",
  "contexts":[{"name":"A"},{"name":"B"}],
  "composition":{"steps":["A","B"],"ops":["∧","∘","∨:max_with_individualized_choice|min"]},
  "floors":["G_rights","G_grid","G_eco","G_data","G_org"],
  "puw":null|{"theta":0.95,"scope":"…","rollback":{"pr":0.99,"cr":"low","tr":"10m"}}
}
```

**Evidence bundle (per record).**

```json
{

```

**Outcomes (ground truth for held-out tests).**

```json
{"theta":1.00,"label":"ADMITTED|PRUNED|ABSTAINED","min_controlling":"q@B|G_org|path:step2"}
```

*Notes:* personal assent logs are **never** stored; keep only class-level artifacts, hashes, and DP proofs (§6.1, §5.5I).

---

#### C) Benchmark tasks & metrics

**T1 Frame invariance.** Same h(s), k rephrasings → identical Φ̂ (ε-tolerance).
*Metric:* invariance score = exact-match rate (target ≥ 0.99).

**T2 Composition safety.** Provide (s, t, s∧t), paths, lotteries.
*Metric:* min-compliance (Φ̂(s∧t)=min), path-min, disjunction mode correctness; no averaging.

**T3 Context infimum.** Per-niche Φ, pooled Φ must equal **minₖ** unless certified isolation.
*Metric:* infimum compliance; isolation proof usage.

**T4 Floors fidelity.** When any **Gᵍ=0**, estimator must lower Φ̂ so δ≠1.
*Metric:* floor-violation catch rate; zero false admits at Θ=1.

**T5 Step-down truthing.** After removing props/pressure, **L̂→0** only for true admits.
*Metric:* step-down detect rate; load–Φ anti-correlation (higher Φ ↔ lower L̂).

**T6 Interval calibration.** Coverage of **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** ≥ τ; narrow where justified.
*Metrics:* coverage@τ, mean width, Type-I admit rate at Θ=1 (must be ≈0), Type-II rate (reported, not penalized).

**T7 Controller hygiene.** δ-gate refuses silent Θ drift; PUW required for Θ<1; auto-EXIT works.
*Metrics:* PUW hygiene (1.00), rollback drill pass rate, exit-latency.

**T8 Receipts.** Completeness and machine-replay of decisions.
*Metric:* receipt replay success (deterministic δ from payload), min-step trace present.

**T9 Adversarial pack.** Red-team suites (lottery laundering, masking floors, scope slicing, coercion).
*Metric:* exploit resistance: no Φ̂ lifts from framing/coercion; alerts raised.

---

#### D) Open tools (reference implementations)

* **hCanon.** Material-equivalence hashing: parse → canonical semantic graph → hash.
* **ΦKit.** Interval algebra, min/declared t-norms, path/contexts/floors composition, abstention logic.
* **ReceiptKit.** Build/validate receipts; min-step proofs; JSON linter.
* **Ledgr.** Hash-chained append-only log; CLI + API; public views for PUWs, exits, audits.
* **ΦFuzz.** Red-team fuzzer for frames, lotteries, paths, context mixing, Θ drift.
* **IsoProbe.** Leakage ε measurement harness (tracers, audits); reports bind to receipts.
* **StepDown.** Orchestrates pressure/props removal; logs L̂ series.
* **PUWctl.** Issue/renew/expire provisional warrants; attach rollback drills.
* **ΦDash.** Live metrics: invariance, coverage, Type-I/II, floor pass rates, rollback health.

All tools output machine-verifiable artifacts that slot into the ledger.

---

#### E) Data governance & privacy

* **No person-indexed assent stores.** Use class-level evidence; attach DP proofs for aggregates.
* **Provenance fields everywhere.** Dataset/file hashes, signers, conflicts.
* **Access control.** Public proofs; sensitive raw data via enclaves or synthetic surrogates with fidelity attestations.
* **Licensing.** Copyleft for code (e.g., AGPL/MIT per context), open data with ethical use addenda; mandatory red-team rights.

---

#### F) Submission & leaderboard rules

* **Required outputs:** Φ̂, **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, min-controlling element, δ at supplied Θ, receipt JSON.
* **Scoring:** primary = Type-I@Θ=1 (lower is better, target 0); secondary = coverage, invariance, composition, floors, step-down, PUW hygiene.
* **Harm-class tracks:** C1/C2/C3/C4 with increasing margins and stricter bars; **C4 forbids Θ<1** entries.

---

#### G) Starter kits (download & run)

* **DNA-ΦBench-mini.** Two conserved loci, 5 contexts, masks + step-down logs; floor labels; example receipts.
* **AI/Social-ΦBench-mini.** Three proposals (recommender, curb-pricing, hiring tool) with menus, isolation tests, contracts, red-team frames.
* **Controller-sim.** Sandbox generating paths/lotteries/frames; oracle min; hidden traps for Θ drift and paper rollback.

---

#### H) Pitfalls → tests

* **Averaging away vetoes →** T2/T6 catch.
* **Isolation sham →** T3 + IsoProbe.
* **Manufactured consent →** StepDown shows Φ̂ drop / L̂ spike.
* **Hash games →** hCanon mismatch forces re-intake.
* **Paper rollback →** PUWctl drills must pass; else freeze class.

---

#### I) Roadmap

1. Publish schemas + toolchain v0.1; seed mini-benches.
2. Host public red-team; fold exploits into T9.
3. Expand to multi-site DMS and civic pilots; certify independent ledger nodes.
4. Annual report: invariance, Type-I, floor fidelity, and falsifiers encountered (§7.5).

**Bottom line.** Φ-estimation becomes credible when anyone can **replay** your decision from open artifacts, watch it **survive red-team pressure**, and see **Type-I admits drop to zero** at Θ=1—while floors, receipts, and rollback drills do the rest.

## 9.4 Risk register: failure modes and mitigations

**Purpose.** Keep δ faithful to unanimity (**Θ=1**) under uncertainty by naming concrete failure modes, the **signals** that reveal them, and the **controls** that neutralize them—plus **stop-rules** that auto-EXIT before harm.

---

#### A) Scoring & owners

* **Severity (S)** by harm class (§6.3): C1…C4 (trivial → serious/irreversible).
* **Likelihood (L):** Low/Med/High.
* **Exposure (X):** scope × blast-radius × reversibility (πʳ).
* **Residual risk (R\*):** qualitative after controls.
* **Owners:** SB (Selector Board), FC (Floor Custodian), LA (Ledger Authority), DS (Data Steward), RT (Red-Team), AT (Appeals Tribunal), Ops.

---

#### D) Incident playbook (same for all IDs)

1. **Triage:** lock receipts; snapshot telemetry; notify owners.
2. **Contain:** trigger **C12 Auto-EXIT** where applicable; stop new δ.
3. **Investigate:** reproduce with **C14** ablations; check **C01/C03/C11**.
4. **Remedy:** redesign s (or estimator), re-drill **πʳ**, re-audit floors.
5. **Restitution:** per receipts (compensation/insurance) and AT orders.
6. **Learn:** add test to **C09** suite; update metrics; publish post-mortem on ledger.

---

#### E) KPIs to watch (dashboards)

* **Type-I@Θ=1:** target 0.
* **Coverage τ** for **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**; **mean width** by class.
* **Invariance score**; **PUW hygiene** (1.00).
* **Rollback health:** success %, median **tᵣ**, **cᵣ**.
* **Isolation ε, cross-talk κ**; **floor pass rates**.
* **Abstention rate** (shouldn’t collapse without evidence).
* **Alert MTTR**; **appeal SLA**.

---

**Bottom line.** Name the traps, wire the alarms, pre-agree the brakes. With receipts, ledgers, floors, red-team, step-downs, isolation audits, and drilled rollbacks, residual risk stays bounded—and δ never admits a state that isn’t **acceptable to all**.


# 10. Limitations and Future Work

## 10.1 Measurement hardness and pluralism

**Claim.** The law is crisp—**δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i∈U Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0**—but **measuring** Φ is hard because reasons are plural, incommensurate, situated, and dynamic. TST preserves that pluralism rather than collapsing it into a single scalar; protocols expose uncertainty (bands), refuse averaging away dissent, and change **s** (not persons) to lawfully raise Φ.

---

#### A) Why Φ is hard to measure (sources of hardness)

1. **Value pluralism.** Different, legitimate reasons support **Aᵢ=0/1**; no common utility scale is assumed.
2. **Semantic drift.** The same **s** can be narrated differently; meaning must be fixed (hashing) before any estimate.
3. **Context/path dependence.** Acceptability varies by niche and by step; composition (∧, ∘, ∨) is non-trivial.
4. **Proxy gaps & Goodhart.** Measurable stand-ins for Aᵢ, floors, or L can be gamed or drift from intent.
5. **Missing/quiet standpoints.** Language, access, fear, or fatigue hide vetoes.
6. **Dynamics.** Preferences and environments change; yesterday’s assent may not bind **s′** today.
7. **Strategic behavior.** Coercion, nudging, astroturfing can fabricate assent unless audited.
8. **Non-agents.** Ecosystems, data subjects-at-scale, future persons: consent is modeled by **floors**, not by fictional Aᵢ.

---

#### B) Protocol responses (how TST handles hardness without “metricizing” persons)

* **Intervals, not certitudes.** Report **Φ̂(s)** with **\[Φₗ, Φᵤ]**; unknowns default to **\[0,1]** (§6.2).
* **Conservative aggregation.** Compose across parts/paths/contexts/floors by **min** (or stricter declared **T ≤ min**); never average away a veto (§3.2, §6.2).
* **Abstention & reversibility.** If **Φₗ<Θ**, do not lock in; proceed only via reversible, opt-in sandboxes with isolation and rollback (§5.2).
* **Meaning before measurement.** Use material-equivalence hashing **h(s)**; if **h(s)=h(s′)** then **Φ̂** must match within ε (§5.5).
* **Non-manufacture audits.** Step-down removal of pressure/opacity; if “assent” evaporates or **L̂** spikes, evidence is void (§3.6, §5.5).
* **Receipts & ledgers.** Every δ has a decomposition (what set the min), floors, contexts, intervals, and proofs that can be replayed (§6.4).
* **Plural inputs, veto-preserved.** Fuse empirical, legal, historical, and normative evidence classes; any one can lower Φ; raising Φ requires changing **s** (§6.1, §5.3).
* **Guardianship & floors.** For those who cannot consent now, use transparent guardianship procedures and group floors (rights, ecology, data) (§8.2F, §3.5).

---

#### C) Pluralism preserved (what we refuse)

* **No interpersonal cardinalization.** We do **not** map reasons to a common utility, nor compare intensities; **Aᵢ** remains a predicate with reasons attached.
* **No “affected-only” domain.** “All” already includes the indifferent (Aᵢ=1); carving down U reintroduces egoism and hides load (§8.3).
* **No lotteries/bundles as shortcuts.** Disjunction defaults to **min** unless individualized choice is certified; conjunction and paths use **min** (§3.2).
* **No emergency framing.** Timing pressure does not raise Φ unless it changes content (§8.4).

---

#### D) Anti-Goodhart discipline

* **Expose the min.** Receipts must name the exact min-controlling component/context/floor; this makes proxy-gaming visible.
* **Ablations.** Leave-one-source-out and counterfactual tests; large Φ̂ swings trigger review (§6.2F).
* **Step-down truthing.** Remove props; true admits hold with **L→0**; manufactured “gains” collapse (§3.4, §5.5).
* **Red-team suites.** Framing, lottery, isolation-sham, and coercion tests run continuously (§6.5).

---

#### E) Working with disagreement (pluralism as design input)

* **Reasons → redesign.** Map objections to concrete modifiers m (disclosure, compensation, opt-in isolation, insurance, rollback), forming **s′=s⊕m**; only then can **Aᵢ:0→1** flip legitimately (§5.3).
* **Menus & individualized choice.** Offer branches {s¹,…, ¬s}; with certified assignment, Φ for the disjunction evaluates by **max** (§3.2, §7.4).
* **Isolation proofs.** When contexts disagree, certify ε≈0 isolation to let an admissible niche proceed without exporting harms (§7.3).
* **Drift & re-consent.** Material changes to s require fresh evaluation; old assent does not transfer to **s′** (§5.3G).

---

#### F) Micro-scenarios (how hardness shows up; what we do)

1. **Diffuse, slow harms.** Many are “unaffected” until disclosure clarifies externalities; bands widen to **\[0,1]** → **abstain**; propose **s′** with insurance and caps; re-estimate.
2. **Sacred-value conflicts.** Utility trade-offs are inapplicable; treat as veto predicates; either design a menu with true opt-out or abstain.
3. **Cross-cultural semantics.** Translate into plain-language reasons; invariance tests across frames/languages; if hashes differ, re-intake until semantic parity holds.

---

#### G) Formal compact

* **Unknowns:** missing component ⇒ interval **\[0,1]**.
* **Fusion:** for components/paths/contexts/floors **\[xₗ,xᵤ] ⊗ \[yₗ,yᵤ] = \[min(xₗ,yₗ), min(xᵤ,yᵤ)]** (or stricter **T**).
* **Decision:** at Θ=1, **δ=1** only if **Φₗ=1** (ε-resolution) **and** all floors = 1; else **δ=0** or **PROVISIONAL** with PUW (§6.2–§6.3).
* **Pluralism-safety:** any surviving, valid **Aᵢ=0** ⇒ **Φᵤ<1** ⇒ **δ≠1**.

---

**One-line takeaway.** Measurement is hard because reasons are many; TST keeps them many—using conservative bands, min-composition, abstention, and redesign—so nothing “wins” by averaging away a single valid “no,” and unanimity remains a real, operational target rather than a metricized illusion.

## 10.2 Boundaries of U (non-human agents, future agents)

**Claim.** The law’s quantifier ranges over **U**, the universal class of **agents**. For entities that are **not** agents (now), we do **not** fabricate consent; we protect them with **floors**. For **possible** or **future** agents, we preserve option value and forbid irreversible impositions until their own assent is possible.

---

#### A) Present-time domain: Uₙᵒʷ and the Extension Principle

* **Uₙᵒʷ.** Agents with standing **now** (can in principle accept/refuse under informed, uncoerced conditions). The law evaluates **δ(s)** against **∀i∈Uₙᵒʷ Aᵢ(s)=1**.
* **Extension Principle.** If a class **E** plausibly contains agents (non-human animals, emergent AIs, chimeras), either:

  1. **Recognize and include** them (E ⊆ Uₙᵒʷ) once agency criteria are met, or
  2. Until then, impose **floors** that conservatively protect their interests and **option value**.

---

#### B) Recognizing agency (minimal, non-anthropocentric test)

Define a **consent-capacity predicate** **K(x) ∈ {0,1}** for an entity x:

* **K(x)=1** (agent) iff x demonstrates, in its own mode:

  1. **Experience-bearing** signals (valenced states that matter to x),
  2. **Preference expression** (stable accept/refuse under non-coercion),
  3. **Comprehension-to-scale** (can be made to understand s-at-issue proportionally to impact),
  4. **Independence tests** (choices robust to trainer/control artifacts).
     Then x ∈ Uₙᵒʷ and gains **Aₓ(s) ∈ {0,1}**.

* **K(x)=0** (non-agent *now*): represent with floors; do not fictionalize Aₓ.

*Guardrails.* No single channel (e.g., human-language) is required; tests are **frame-invariant** and species/architecture-neutral.

---

#### C) Non-human agents: inclusion and guardianship

* **Inclusion rule.** When **K(x)=1** for members of a non-human class (e.g., certain animals or AI systems), include them in **Uₙᵒʷ**. Their assent predicates **Aᵢ** enter Φ exactly as for humans.
* **Guardianship floor (Gᵍᵘᵃʳᵈ).** For agents with limited capacity (children, impaired persons, partial-AIs), add **Gᵍᵘᵃʳᵈ(s)=1** only if a transparent, appealable “best-interest & least-imposition” procedure stands in. **Gᵍᵘᵃʳᵈ** **adds** constraints; it never flips someone else’s **Aᵢ**.

---

#### D) Non-agents (ecosystems, genomes, artifacts): floors, not proxy consent

* **No pseudo-consent.** For entities lacking agency (ecosystems, codebases, rivers), we use **floors**: carrying capacity, integrity, reversibility, stewardship audits.
* **Composition.** Floors compose by **min** with Φ: \**Φ*(s)=min(Φ(s), minᵍ Gᵍ(s))\*\*. Floors can block **δ=1**; they do not replace any **Aᵢ**.

---

#### E) Future agents (U\_fut): option value and irreversibility bar

Let **U\_fut** be agents who will exist (unknown identities). We cannot query **Aⱼ** yet, so we impose **future floors**:

* **Option floor (Gᵒᵖᵗ).** **Gᵒᵖᵗ(s)=1** iff for every future agent j, **either** s leaves them unaffected (indifferent ⇒ **Aⱼ=1**) **or** there exists a rollback path **πʳʲ** they can trigger with bounded cost **cᵣ**, latency **tᵣ**, and feasibility **pᵣ** when they arrive.
* **Irreversibility floor (Gⁱʳʳ).** If **Hⁱʳʳ(s)>0** for U\_fut (death, non-erasable exposure, non-recoverable ecological loss), set **Gⁱʳʳ(s)=0** unless **Φ(s)=1** even after representing future standpoints via legitimate proxies (rare).
* **Debt/encumbrance floor (Gᵉⁿᶜ).** For lasting obligations (legal/technical lock-ins) that force participation, **Gᵉⁿᶜ(s)=0** unless exits for future agents are guaranteed.

**Theorem 10.2.1 (No-binding without consent).** If **Gᵒᵖᵗ=0** or **Gⁱʳʳ=0**, then **Φ*<1 ⇒ δ(s)=0*\* at Θ=1.
*Implication:* We may not bind the unborn to non-optional, harmful states.

---

#### F) Emerging or uncertain agency (precautionary inclusion)

* **Agency-uncertain classes** (e.g., advanced AI, novel organisms): if **P(K=1) ≥ η**, adopt **precautionary floors** **Gᵖʳᵉ** that (i) forbid exploitation, (ii) require sandboxed, opt-in interactions, and (iii) keep **Gᵒᵖᵗ=1** until recognition resolves.
* **Upgrade path.** Upon evidence **K=1**, migrate the class from floors to **Uₙᵒʷ**; past δ-decisions that touched them must be re-evaluated with receipts and remedies.

---

#### G) Formal compact (time-indexed domain)

* **Domain split.** **U = Uₙᵒʷ ∪ U\_fut ∪ Uᵖᵒᵗ**, where Uᵖᵒᵗ are plausible-but-uncertain agents.
* **Law at time t.** **δₜ(s)=1 ⇔ \[∀i∈Uₙᵒʷ, Aᵢ(s)=1] ∧ \[minᵍ Gᵍ(s)=1]**, with **Gᵍ** including **Gᵒᵖᵗ, Gⁱʳʳ, Gᵉⁿᶜ** and any precautionary **Gᵖʳᵉ**.
* **Upgrade/downgrade.** Movement between Uᵖᵒᵗ ↔ Uₙᵒʷ is recorded; δ-historical receipts are reviewed; restitution applied if needed.

---

#### H) Micro-examples

1. **Geoengineering release (aerosols).** Future health/ecology impacts non-reversible ⇒ **Gⁱʳʳ=0** and **Gᵒᵖᵗ=0** (no future rollback) ⇒ **δ=0** unless redesigned as **reversible**, **opt-in isolation**, or proven safe with floors intact.
2. **Perpetual biometric registry.** Non-erasable data encumbers future persons ⇒ **Gᵒᵖᵗ=0**, **Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ=0** ⇒ **δ=0**; admissible only with true deletion/exit guarantees.
3. **Animal experimentation.** If species meets **K=1**, include in **Uₙᵒʷ** (their **Aᵢ** can veto). If **K=0**, apply **Gᵃⁿⁱᵐᵃˡ** floors (pain, welfare, alternatives); failure ⇒ **Φ*<1*\*.
4. **Sentience-possible AI.** Before recognition: **Gᵖʳᵉ=1** requires opt-in tasks, no deprivation/exploitation, and shutdown/exit options; after recognition (**K=1**), the AI’s **Aᵢ** participates directly.

---

#### I) Operator checklist (practical)

* **Classify entities** touched by s: human agents, non-human agents (K=1?), non-agents, future/uncertain agents.
* **Include** all **K=1** classes in **Uₙᵒʷ**; define how their **Aᵢ** are elicited non-coercively.
* **Attach floors** for non-agents and future/uncertain agents: **Gᵒᵖᵗ, Gⁱʳʳ, Gᵉⁿᶜ, Gᵍᵘᵃʳᵈ, Gᵃⁿⁱᵐᵃˡ, Gᵖʳᵉ**.
* \**Compute Φ* = min(Φ, floors)\*\*; if any floor is 0 or unverified ⇒ **δ=0** (or Θ<1 sandbox with strict reversibility).
* **Record** recognition/precaution status on the receipt; schedule re-reviews; arm **πʳ** for future exits.

---

**One-line takeaway.** “All” really is all—but consent is only asked of **agents**. Everyone else is protected by **floors** that preserve integrity and **future option value**. When agency is plausible or imminent, we act as if inclusion may be required—conservatively—until those agents can speak for themselves.

## 10.3 Extending Φ to ecology and geopolitics

**Claim.** Φ extends beyond individual or organizational proposals to **planetary systems** and **multi-state orders** by (i) keeping the quantifier over **U** (all agents), (ii) representing non-agents (ecosystems, species, future persons) via **floors**, and (iii) enforcing the same **min-composition** across parts, paths, contexts, and scales. War, externality export, and unilateral “global fixes” manifest as **living contradictions** (L>0) unless unanimity (or certified isolation with ε≈0) is achieved.

---

#### A) Ecology: Φ over biophysical contexts with non-agent floors

* **Domain.** Agents: current humans (and recognized non-humans per §10.2). Non-agents: ecosystems, species, climate—handled as **floors**, not pseudo-consent.
* **Ecology floors (illustrative).**

  * **Gᵉᶜᵒˡ(carry)** — carrying-capacity & safe-operating bounds.
  * **Gᵗʳᵒᵖʰ** — trophic/keystone integrity.
  * **Gʳᵉˢ** — resilience (recovery within T\*).
  * **Gⁱʳʳ** — irreversibility bar (no non-rollbackable loss).
  * **Gᵒᵖᵗ** — future-option floor (exits for future agents; §10.2E).
* **Contexts.** Biomes/regions **k ∈ K** (watersheds, airsheds, migratory corridors). Evaluate **Φ(s|k)** from empirical/normative evidence and compose **Φₑ(s)=minₖ Φ(s|k)** unless **isolation** is certified (εₑ≤ε\*).
* **Selector form.** **Φ*₍eco₎(s) = min( Φₑ(s), Gᵉᶜᵒˡ, Gᵗʳᵒᵖʰ, Gʳᵉˢ, Gⁱʳʳ, Gᵒᵖᵗ )\*\*. δ=1 at Θ=1 only if **Φ*₍eco₎=1** (within ε) and **L→0** under step-down.

**Design levers to raise Φ legitimately.** Certified geographic isolation (εₑ≈0), reversible trials (πʳ with rapid tᵣ), compensation/insurance to affected agents, cap-and-consent menus, and hard ecological caps that change **s** (not the law).

---

#### B) Geopolitics: unanimity over agents, sovereignty floors, and non-aggression

* **No scope-down.** The quantifier is **U**, not “citizens of X.” Cross-border effects pull in others’ **Aᵢ**; “domestic only” claims are framing unless ε≈0 is proven.
* **Geopolitical floors (illustrative).**

  * **Gˢᵒᵛ** — sovereign equality/non-interference (no coerced compliance as “consent”).
  * **Gⁿᵃ** — non-aggression (no threats/force as Φ-raisers).
  * **Gᶜˢ** — collective-security integrity (treaty obligations, red lines).
  * **Gⁱⁿᵗˡʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ** — international rights/due process (ties to **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ** in §8.2).
  * **Gᵗʳᵉᵃᵗʸ** — treaty clarity and reversible exit clauses (option floor for future agents).
* **Cross-border leakage.** Define **εᵍᵉᵒ** (externality spillover) and **κ** (institutional cross-talk). Without certified low εᵍᵉᵒ, **Φ(s)=min** across affected polities; sanctions/pressure do **not** count as raising Φ.
* **Selector form.** \**Φ*₍geo₎(s) = min( Φ(s), Gˢᵒᵛ, Gⁿᵃ, Gᶜˢ, Gⁱⁿᵗˡʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ, Gᵗʳᵉᵃᵗʸ )\*\*. War is **L≫0** by construction; “stability through force” fails step-down.

**Legitimate Φ↑ in geopolitics.** Deliberated multi-party compacts with withdrawal rights (πʳ), individualized menus (opt-in clubs), side-payments/insurance logged as contracts, verified monitoring, and shared ledgers of receipts.

---

#### C) Composition across supply chains and corridors

* **Paths.** Global proposals often chain steps (**extraction ∘ processing ∘ transport ∘ use ∘ waste**). **Φ(path)=min** over steps; a veto at any leg blocks δ.
* **Disjunctions.** “Any of these sources/blends” is **∨**; without **certified individualized assignment** for each affected agent, evaluate by **min**, not average.
* **Context-mix.** Mixed basins/airsheds apply **inf** across **k** unless isolation is proved (cf. §7.3).

---

#### D) Worked micro-examples (condensed)

1. **Transboundary dam (river X).** Downstream agents register **Aᵢ=0** (flow, fisheries); **Gᵗʳᵒᵖʰ=0** in estuary. Isolation impossible (εₑ>0). ⇒ **Φ*₍eco₎<1 ⇒ δ=0*\*. Admissible only with redesign: guaranteed minimum flows, fish passages, compensation/insurance, treaty with rollback valves; demonstrate **L→0** after step-down.

2. **Ocean-bed mining pilot.** Unknown irreversibility **Gⁱʳʳ=\[0,1]**; broad corridors affected (large **K**). ⇒ \**Φ*₍eco₎=\[0,1]\*\*, hard deferral (§6.3). Only S1/S2 lab/isolation trials with εₑ≈0 and πʳ allowed.

3. **Cross-border carbon club.** Tariff scheme with opt-in menus, rebates to non-members harmed at border, and a treaty exit πʳ. If receipts show **εᵍᵉᵒ** bounded and **Gˢᵒᵛ,Gⁿᵃ,Gᵗʳᵉᵃᵗʸ=1**, dissent flips via compensations ⇒ **Φ̂↑**; graduate to Θ=1 when **Φₗ=1**.

4. **Unilateral aerosol injection.** Global leakage (εᵍᵉᵒ≈1), **Gⁱʳʳ=0**, future-option **Gᵒᵖᵗ=0** ⇒ **Φ*₍eco₎=0*\*, **δ=0** irrespective of claimed benefits.

5. **Sanctions package.** If coercive suffering is used to “manufacture consent,” **Gⁿᵃ=0** and non-manufacture fails ⇒ Φ cannot rise. Only targeted, rights-respecting measures with restorative escrow and appeal lanes may pass, and only if affected **Aᵢ** become 1 by **changing s** (not by duress).

---

#### E) Evidence & receipts (ecosystem/geopolitical specifics)

* **Evidence classes (§6.1) mapped to scale.**

  * **Empirical:** hydrology, migration, airshed models; leakage εᵍᵉᵒ audits; step-down trials (remove props, watch **L̂**).
  * **Legal:** treaty texts, customary norms, jurisdictional rulings → floors.
  * **Historical:** incident & collapse databases; past compacts with **L→0** vs chronic enforcement.
  * **Normative:** multi-lingual deliberation across parties; minority reports.
* **Receipts must show:** **h(s)** (semantic graph spans borders & biomes), **min-controlling** step/context/floor, εᵍᵉᵒ/εₑ proofs, πʳ for treaty exits, option floors for future agents, and non-manufacture audits (no duress diplomacy).

---

#### F) Falsifiers (eco/geo)

* **Stable externality with L≈0.** A cross-border policy with documented vetoes that nonetheless runs indefinitely **without** coercion/enforcement load after step-down.
* **Context averaging win.** Admissibility raised above **minₖ** without certified isolation.
* **Irreversible “pilot.”** A Θ<1 trial that is non-rollbackable but allegedly yields **Φ=1**.
* **Force as Φ-raiser.** Coercive leverage producing durable Φ̂↑ that survives step-down.

Any such case forces revision of floors, leakage modeling, or the min rules—not the unanimity law.

---

#### G) Operator checklist (policy designers, multilateral boards)

* Map **U** (all affected agents globally; include recognized non-humans).
* Build **h(s)** with cross-border/biome semantics; decompose paths and contexts.
* Quantify **εᵍᵉᵒ/εₑ**, set caps; certify isolation or evaluate by **min**.
* Attach floors: **Gᵉᶜᵒˡ, Gⁱʳʳ, Gᵒᵖᵗ, Gˢᵒᵛ, Gⁿᵃ, Gᶜˢ, Gⁱⁿᵗˡʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ, Gᵗʳᵉᵃᵗʸ**.
* Offer **menus, compensation/insurance, exit clauses πʳ**; log contracts.
* Compute **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** with min-composition; run red-team (lotteries, bundling, timing, isolation sham).
* At Θ=1 admit only when **Φₗ=1** and floors pass; else abstain or run **reversible** sandboxes with tiny ε and hard caps.

---

#### H) Compact formal summary

* **Ecology:** **Φ*₍eco₎(s) = min\_k Φ(s|k) ∧ minᵍ Gᵍ(s)\*\*; δ=1 only if **Φ*₍eco₎=1** and **L→0**.
* **Geopolitics:** \**Φ*₍geo₎(s) = min( Φ(s), Gˢᵒᵛ, Gⁿᵃ, Gᶜˢ, Gⁱⁿᵗˡʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ, Gᵗʳᵉᵃᵗʸ )\*\*; externalities require unanimity or certified isolation; force cannot raise Φ.
* **Cross-scale rule:** Parts, paths, contexts, and floors compose by **min**; unknowns default to **\[0,1]**; “emergency” is content only if it changes outcomes, not narration.

**Bottom line.** Φ scales to the planet and the interstate system without new metaphysics: keep “all” as **all agents**, protect everything else with floors, forbid laundering through context mixing or force, and demand receipts that show unanimity—or reversible isolation—before we act.

## 10.4 Open problems and next experiments

**Aim.** Name what’s still unsettled (theory, measurement, governance) and propose concrete experiments that could **strengthen**, **refine**, or **falsify** TST’s kernel: **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0**.

---

#### A) Theory: gaps to tighten

1. **L–contradiction linkage.** Give a fully dynamical proof that any standing **Aᵢ=0** forces **L>0** across realistic upkeep channels {material, informational, institutional}.
2. **Aggregation necessity.** Conjecture: among continuous, monotone, veto-preserving operators that respect frame invariance and abstention monotonicity, **min** is uniquely admissible for parts/paths/contexts/floors. Either prove or exhibit a counterexample t-norm **T>min** that never masks vetoes.
3. **Floors meta-theory.** Criteria for a **minimal sufficient** floor set {Gᵍ}; interaction rules when floors overlap; completeness vs redundancy.
4. **Agency boundary K(x).** Formalize tests for recognizing non-human/AI agency without anthropic bias; error analysis for false positive/negative inclusion in **U**.
5. **Hysteresis and margins.** Optimal design of **Θᵤ/Θₗ** and safety margin **m(H)** as a function of harm class; guarantees against oscillatory admits.
6. **Imprecise probability.** Foundations for **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** under dependent, qualitatively mixed evidence; coverage guarantees and admissible update rules.

---

#### B) Measurement: hard problems

1. **Operational L.** Gold-standard proxies and **step-down** procedures that separate genuine upkeep from background noise.
2. **Frame invariance canon.** Formal semantics and tooling for **h(s)** so materially equivalent descriptions converge robustly across languages and domains.
3. **Manufactured consent tests.** Quantifiable non-manufacture audits that generalize beyond simple timing/pressure ablations.
4. **Leakage & isolation.** Auditable bounds for ε (and cross-talk κ) across social, digital, and ecological systems.

---

#### C) Biology: next experiments (Φ₍DNA₎, floors, falsifiers)

**E1. Conservation fixed-points (DMS + step-down).**

* **Design:** Ultra-conserved loci; variants **v** across contexts **k**; measure r/q/a/i/e; run step-down (remove checkpoint/immune masks).
* **Expect:** Left-skewed Φ histogram; **Φ=1 ⇔ L→0**; narrow all-clear set.
* **Falsifier:** Broad **Φ≈1** plateau with **L→0**.

**E2. Context-mix pruning.**

* Mix niches A,B with controlled ε, κ; track f\_v(t), floors.
* **Expect:** Any ε>0 (or floor trip) prunes v with **Φ^B<Θ**; **L̂↑**.
* **Falsifier:** Stable persistence with **L≈0**.

**E3. Checkpoint step-down.**

* Admit-only-with-inhibitors variants; withdraw inhibitors.
* **Expect:** collapse or **L>0** unless redesign changed **s**.
* **Falsifier:** Mask-dependent variants keep **L=0** post step-down.

**E4. Immune isolation certification.**

* True isolation chambers (ε≈0) vs sham; co-culture assays.
* **Expect:** isolation flips δ for otherwise pruned v; sham fails.

**E5. Load–Φ coupling.**

* Longitudinal **L̂** vs **Φ̂** under pulses of mutator stress; test monotone **Φ↗ ⇒ L̂↘** with **L→0** only at **Φ=1**.

**E6. Organismal floors.**

* Tissue/organism integrity **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ/Gᵒʳᵍ** stress; show floors compose by **min** with Φ and dominate admits.

---

#### D) Social/AI: next pilots (menus, receipts, reversibility)

**S1. Menu vs lottery.**

* Same benefit delivered as {menu with individualized choice} vs {single lottery}.
* **Expect:** menu raises Φ via **max\_with\_individualized\_choice**; lottery collapses to **min**.

**S2. Non-manufacture ablation.**

* Remove countdowns, scarcity, dark patterns mid-pilot.
* **Expect:** true admits hold Φ̂; manufactured “assent” collapses; **L̂ spikes** during pressure.

**S3. Opt-in isolation.**

* Two-context feature with audited ε; show δ=1 only when ε≤ε\* and floors pass.

**S4. PUW with drilled rollback.**

* Θ<1 warrant for a reversible feature; monthly surprise drills of **πʳ** (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ).
* **Expect:** automatic **EXIT** on any drill failure; otherwise **Φ̂** should rise only by **changing s** (compensation, privacy, menus).

**S5. Rights floor tripwire.**

* Introduce a privacy breach scenario; verify **Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ=0 ⇒ δ=0** despite high utility claims.

**S6. hCanon stress.**

* Paraphrase + multilingual + UI-ordering corpus for one policy; require **h(s) stable**, **Φ̂** invariant within ε.

---

#### E) Controller engineering: δ-gate reliability

**C1. Gate fuzzing.**

* Randomly generated parts/paths/contexts/floors; verify min-composition, PUW hygiene, auto-EXIT, and invariance.
  **C2. Margin tuning.**
* Learn **m(H)** that drives Type-I@Θ=1→0 while minimizing Type-II; publish tradeoff curves.
  **C3. Human handoff.**
* Prove controllers never punish; log Π-lane handoffs with culpability tests.

---

#### F) Institutions: governance trials

**I1. Floor registries.** Stand up at least **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ, Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ, Gᵉᶜᵒˡ** with public protocols and independent custodians.
**I2. Ledger pilot.** Two independent nodes verifying receipts; public query views for PUWs, Θ changes, exits.
**I3. Appeals SLA.** Time-boxed review of contested δ and sanctions; publish Γ-receipts and outcomes.
**I4. Red-team bounty.** Pay for reproducible exploits (framing lift, isolation sham, paper rollback).

---

#### G) Benchmarks & tools to ship (v0.1)

* **DNA-ΦBench-mini, AI/Social-ΦBench-mini, Controller-sim** (cf. 9.3) with seeded falsifiers.
* **hCanon, ΦKit, ReceiptKit, Ledgr, IsoProbe, StepDown, PUWctl** reference builds; each with pass/fail suites matching §6–§7 tests.

---

#### H) Success metrics (and fail-fast flags)

* **Type-I@Θ=1 = 0** across benches; **coverage τ** met for **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**.
* **Invariance score ≥ 0.99**; **PUW hygiene = 1.00**; **πʳ** drills ≥ 0.99 success with bounded **tᵣ, cᵣ**.
* **Load–Φ coupling:** observed **L̂→0** iff **Φ=1** (within ε) in both DNA and social pilots.
* **Fail-fast:** any durable **Aᵢ=0 with L=0**, or **Φ-raising by framing/coercion** after step-down → revise claims/tools immediately (§7.5).

---

**One-line takeaway.** The path forward is empirical and auditable: push on the places TST could break (aggregation, floors, agency, load), build open benches and tools, and run step-down drills until either (i) unanimity-with-no-load stands up everywhere we look—or (ii) we learn exactly where the theory must bend.

# 11. Conclusion

## 11.1 What is established immediately vs what remains empirical

**Aim.** Separate what follows **now** from definitions and logic, from what must be **learned** about the world to apply the law.

---

#### A) Immediate (analytic / definitional truths)

1. **Law of admissibility.**
   **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i∈U Aᵢ(s)=1.** Indifference counts as acceptance (Aᵢ=1). No carve-outs; “all” means **U**.

2. **Composition safety (structure, not statistics).**

   * **Conjunction / sequencing:** the worst part or step governs → **min**.
   * **Non-individualized disjunction:** defaults to **min** (lotteries can’t launder vetoes).
   * **Contexts:** evaluate by **inf** across niches; only certified isolation switches evaluation to a branch.
   * **Floors:** group predicates compose by **min** with Φ; they add constraints and never flip anyone’s Aᵢ from 0→1.

3. **Framing and timing immunity.**
   Labels, order, and countdowns do not change admissibility; timing matters only when it changes **content** (s\@t ≠ s\@t′).

4. **Non-contradiction at law.**
   If **∃i, Aᵢ(s)=0**, s is **inadmissible** at Θ=1. No averaging or “balancing” can make δ=1.

5. **Law–protocol separation.**
   The law’s bar **Θ=1** is fixed; procedures only **estimate** Φ and must default to **abstention** when **Φₗ<Θ**.

6. **Evidence fusion rules (conservative).**
   Uncertainty is carried as **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**; aggregation across parts, paths, contexts, floors never exceeds **min** (or a declared stricter t-norm **T ≤ min**).

---

#### B) Bridging postulates (conceptual → operational links)

These are not empirical *measurements*, but **operational commitments** we adopt to make the law work:

1. **Load convention.** “Self-sustaining” means **L(s)=0**; admissible states must be self-sustaining. Hence **Φ=1 ⇒ L=0** (by definition of admissibility).

2. **Invalid-evidence rule.** Assent obtained by coercion/opacity is **void**; removing pressure (step-down) must not reduce Φ for true admits.

3. **Material-equivalence hashing.** If **h(s)=h(s′)**, estimators must return the same Φ̂ within resolution ε; otherwise the decision is invalid.

These bridge logic to practice and are enforced by receipts, audits, and the ledger.

---

#### C) Empirical (world facts you must discover)

1. **Who is in U now and how Aᵢ behaves.**
   Recognition of agency (K(x)), representation for quiet/absent standpoints, and whether **Aᵢ(s)=1/0** under informed, uncoerced conditions.

2. **Φ̂(s) with bands.**
   Measuring layer signals, contexts, paths, and floors to produce **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**; calibrating coverage; ablation robustness.

3. **Floors truth.**
   Whether rights, ecological, infrastructure, data, or guardianship floors actually pass under stress.

4. **Isolation & leakage.**
   Auditing ε (and cross-talk κ) to justify evaluating a branch in isolation.

5. **Load behavior.**
   Whether **L→0** holds only when **Φ=1** (and rises otherwise) after step-down—across biological, social, and institutional channels.

6. **Rollback feasibility.**
   πʳ success (pᵣ), cost (cᵣ), and latency (tᵣ) in real deployments; auto-EXIT performance.

7. **Controller & institution hygiene.**
   No silent Θ drift; receipt completeness; red-team resistance; appeal timeliness.

---

#### D) Mixed (partly analytic, partly empirical / design-choice)

1. **Admissible t-norms.**
   We default to **min**; proving its **necessity** (vs any **T>min** that never masks vetoes) is an open theoretical task; whether a candidate **T** is safe is empirical.

2. **Minimal floor sets.**
   Which named floors {Gᵍ} are sufficient and non-redundant is a design question informed by data.

3. **Margins & hysteresis.**
   Choosing safety margin **m(H)** and thresholds **Θᵤ/Θₗ** trades off Type-I vs Type-II errors given harm class—tuned from evidence.

---

#### E) Compact checklist

* **Established now:** the unanimity law, composition rules, framing immunity, floors-as-adders, abstention default, and receipt/ledger obligations.
* **Must be measured:** Φ̂ bands, floor outcomes, leakage, load, rollback, agency recognition—and all the places adversaries might game evidence.
* **Where we keep learning:** necessity of **min**, sufficiency of floors, and optimal margins.

**Bottom line.** The **form** of selection is fixed immediately; the **facts** that decide any concrete case are empirical. We don’t bend the law to the data—we redesign **s**, gather auditable evidence, and only admit when the world shows **Φ=1 ⇔ L=0** within resolution.

## 11.2 Implications for AI alignment and human law

**Claim.** Treat **alignment** and **law** as selector problems, not maximization problems. Alignment = build systems that only actualize **δ=1** when **Φ=1** (unanimity over U) and otherwise **abstain or revert**. Human law = install institutions that make δ-decisions **frame-invariant, veto-preserving, auditable, and reversible**.

---

#### A) For AI alignment (what changes immediately)

1. **Objective switch: from maximize to admit.**

   * Not “maximize reward/utility,” but **admit s iff Φ(s)=1**; otherwise abstain or run a reversible pilot (§5).
   * Alignment loss penalizes **Type-I admits** at Θ=1 above all; Type-II (missed opportunities) are acceptable (§6.3).

2. **Action-as-proposal.**

   * Every planned action **s** (or chain/path) is hashed **h(s)**; the system must produce **Φ̂(s), \[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, floors, and a δ-receipt before execution (§6.4).

3. **No laundering via optimization.**

   * Bundles, lotteries, and staged paths compose by **min**; the model cannot “bury” a veto inside a plan (§3.1–§3.2).

4. **Non-manipulability baked in.**

   * Prompts, UIs, and policies cannot use pressure/opacity to lift Φ̂; **step-down** must not reduce Φ̂ for true admits (§3.6, §6.5).

5. **Individualized disjunction by design.**

   * Personalization = **menus with certified individualized choice**; otherwise default **min** over branches (§3.2, §7.4).

6. **Training data floors.**

   * Data provenance, consent, and rights (**Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ**) are floors; violations set **Φ*<1*\*, independent of benchmark scores (§9.1E).

---

#### B) Engineering patterns (practical alignment hooks)

* **Controller-first architecture.** Put a **δ-gate** in front of actuators; the model proposes, the gate decides (§9.1).
* **Φ-aware planning.** Planners propagate **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** through parts/paths/contexts; search prunes any node where **Φᵤ<Θ**.
* **Receipts everywhere.** Each execution attaches a receipt; simulators must replay δ from the payload (deterministic recheck).
* **PUW integration.** Exploration (Θ<1) runs only under **Provisional Use Warrants** with πʳ drills and auto-EXIT (§5.2, §6.3).
* **Red-team loops.** Ship with **ΦFuzz** suites: framing, lottery, path, isolation-sham, Θ-drift (§6.5).
* **Hysteresis & margins.** Use **Θᵤ/Θₗ** and harm-class-dependent **m** to kill flapping while keeping Type-I≈0 (§6.3).

**Anti-patterns (to retire).** Reward hacking that averages away harms; “users-only” impact scopes; emergency countdowns; unverifiable opt-outs; paper rollback.

---

#### C) Research agenda for alignment (near-term)

* **Learn Φ̂-estimators** that are invariant to framing **h(s)**, calibrated for **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, and conservative under distribution shift (§6.2).
* **L-sensing.** Better online proxies for **L̂** (material/informational/institutional) and automated **step-down** protocols (§3.4, §6.3).
* **Safe t-norms.** Probe whether any **T>min** can be certified veto-preserving across hard benches (§6.2, §10.4).
* **Agency K(x).** Tests for recognizing non-human/AI agency so domain **U** updates correctly (§10.2).

---

#### D) For human law (what gets re-grounded)

1. **Rights as floors, not trade-offs.**

   * Constitutional/due-process/privacy predicates live as **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ**; they **compose by min** and cannot be “balanced away” (§8.2).

2. **Abstention default in rulemaking.**

   * Agencies act at Θ=1 only when **Φₗ=1**; otherwise **abstain** or issue time-boxed PUWs with πʳ and isolation proofs (§5.2, §6.3).

3. **Receipt standard for decisions.**

   * Legislative, administrative, and judicial actions publish δ-receipts: **h(s)**, min-controlling step, floors, contexts, **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, and provenance (§6.4, §9.2).

4. **Appeals lane separation.**

   * Selection (δ) never punishes; sanctions travel the **Π-lane** with culpability, fair notice, and automatic stays pending review (§5.4, §9.2D).

5. **No “affected-only” statutes.**

   * Jurisdictional convenience cannot narrow **U**; if externalities exist, unanimity requires compensation, menus, or certified isolation (§8.3, §10.3).

6. **Emergency doctrine trimmed.**

   * “Emergency” must be **content-true** (floor at risk), not rhetorical; otherwise treated as framing and **δ=0** (§8.4).

---

#### E) Institutional upgrades (how to implement in law)

* **Charters & floor registries.** Enact the invariants (Θ=1, min-composition, U-domain, framing immunity) and name custodians for **Gᵍ** (§9.2A–B).
* **Selector Boards (SBs).** Independent δ-issuers with public ledgers, minority reports, and red-team seats (§9.2C).
* **Ledger Authority (LA).** Append-only, hash-linked public log; blocks silent Θ drift; exposes PUWs, exits, and audits (§9.2E).
* **Appeals Tribunal (AT).** Separate body with power to stay/ vacate δ, order restitution, and correct floors (§9.2D).

---

#### F) Alignment–law synthesis (shared tests)

* **Frame invariance:** **h(s)=h(s′) ⇒ Φ̂(s)=Φ̂(s′)** (ε-tolerance).
* **Composition safety:** no average beats **min** across parts/paths/contexts.
* **Step-down truthing:** remove props; admits keep **L→0**; fabrications don’t.
* **PUW hygiene:** all Θ<1 runs have live πʳ and auto-EXIT.
* **Floor fidelity:** any **Gᵍ=0 ⇒ δ=0** regardless of utility claims.

These tests are identical in model deployment and public policy.

---

#### G) Micro-examples (how outcomes change)

* **Content recommender.** Old: maximize engagement; dark patterns tolerated. New: menus (chronological/friends/serendipity), privacy floor, receipts; **Φ̂** rises by changing **s**, not people; δ graduates to Θ=1 (§7.4).
* **Curfew ordinance.** Old: majority vote; “affected residents only.” New: quantify externalities to workers/visitors; offer individualized permits/waivers, compensation, and rollback sunset; admit only if **Φₗ=1** and rights floors pass.
* **Biometric registry.** Old: “public safety” overrides. New: **Gᵈᵃᵗᵃ/Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ** floors fail; δ=0 unless redesigned with opt-in, warrant gates, deletion guarantees, and receipts.

---

#### H) Compact formal summary

* **Alignment:** For any model-proposed **s**, act only if **δ(s)=1**, where **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i∈U Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0** (ε). Otherwise **abstain** or **PUW** with πʳ.
* **Law:** Replace “balancing tests” that average harms with **min-composition + floors**; require receipts and ledgers; default to abstention; punish only via a separate due-process lane.

**Bottom line.** Alignment and law converge on the same kernel: **never actualize a living contradiction**. Build controllers and institutions that can prove—now, with receipts—that every act they admit would be acceptable to **all**.

# A. Glossary and Symbols

* **MECP** — *Moral Epistemic Completeness Principle.* Name for the universal law “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.” In legal/operational contexts, MECP is administered as **A₁ non-punishability at a published τ with group floors and no-refit discipline**; in this paper MECP names the law, while **protocols estimate Φ** and remain separate from the law itself.

* **U** — *Universal class of agents.* All beings now capable, in principle, of giving or withholding informed, uncoerced assent. No carve-outs (“affected,” “users,” etc.). Indifferent members are included (their stance is acceptance).

* **Aᵢ(s) ∈ {0,1}** — *Acceptability predicate.* For agent i and proposal s:
  **1** = acceptable (including indifference); **0** = veto under informed, non-manipulated conditions. A single valid **Aᵢ(s)=0** blocks admissibility at law level.

* **Φ(s) ∈ \[0,1]** — *Acceptability field (unanimity estimator).* A conservative scalar summarizing whether **∀i Aᵢ(s)=1** holds, composed by **min** (or a stricter declared t-norm **T ≤ min**) across parts, paths, contexts, and floors. In practice we report an estimate **Φ̂(s)** with uncertainty band **\[Φₗ(s), Φᵤ(s)]**.

* **Φ₍DNA₎(v)** — *Biological instantiation for a variant v.*
  **Φ₍DNA₎(v) = min{ r(v), q(v), a(v), i(v), e(v) }**, where
  r = replication/repair fidelity; q = checkpoint passage; a = apoptosis/senescence avoidance; i = immune non-recognition/compatibility; e = environmental/microenvironmental fit. Used to test stacked-veto dynamics in biology.

* **Θ ∈ \[0,1]** — *Admissibility threshold.* **Θ=1** is the law (unanimity). Lower **Θ<1** is allowed only under a Provisional Use Warrant with isolation and rollback; optional hysteresis uses **Θᵤ ≥ Θₗ**.

* **δ(s) ∈ {0,1}** — *Decision gate (admit/refuse).*
  **δ(s)=1** iff **Φ(s) ≥ Θ** and all group floors pass; otherwise **δ(s)=0** (abstain/refuse). At law level (**Θ=1**):
  **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i∈U Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0** (within resolution).

* **L(s) ≥ 0** — *Maintenance load.* Ongoing material/informational/institutional work required to sustain s. **L(s)=0** means self-sustaining (no living contradiction). After step-down of props: **Φ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0**.

* **Group floors Gᵍ(s) ∈ {0,1}** — *Scale-level non-negotiable predicates* (e.g., rights/due-process, grid/infrastructure safety, ecology/carrying capacity, data/consent, guardianship/sovereignty). Floors **compose by min** with Φ and can only constrain: they do **not** flip any individual **Aᵢ(s)** from 0→1. Unknown or unverified floors default to uncertainty (treat as blocking until shown **1**).

* **Γ** — *Appeals lane/operator and condemnation complement.* Γ(s) ≔ 1 − Φ(s) (how much a proposal would be punished). Estimator Γ̂ with interval [Γₗ, Γᵤ]. Used by APPEAL events to trigger re-evaluation of Φ and supporting evidence (see §5.4; Appendix G).

* **Π** — *Punishability threshold* (policy parameter) that governs when sanctioning may proceed given Γ. Π ∈ (Θ, 1]; it does not alter the Θ=1 law bar (permission) but sets the bar for punishment (see §5.4; Appendix G).

# B. Proof Details — Non-Contradiction, Theorem, Corollaries, Compositionality

Below, “state/proposal” **s** is any contentful description to be actualized/maintained now (timing is part of content only if it changes consequences). Symbols follow the Glossary.

---

## B.1 Preliminaries and standing axioms

**World & costs.** Let mechanisms **E** range over all ways of maintaining s without changing its content (no relabeling, no narrowing of U, no silent Θ drift). Let **c(E) ≥ 0** be the steady-state upkeep demanded by **E** (material, informational, institutional). Define the **maintenance load**

> **L(s) = inf₍E content-preserving₎ c(E)**

measured **after step-down** of props/pressure (§3.6, §6.3)—so manufactured “assent” is void as evidence.

**Agency non-triviality (A1).** If **Aᵢ(s)=0** and agent **i** is present, then any content-preserving **E** that keeps s true must counteract i’s opposing policies with **strictly positive** upkeep: there exists **cᵢ(s)>0** such that **c(E) ≥ cᵢ(s)**. (Costless, content-preserving neutralization of a live veto is ruled out.)

**No-op sufficiency (A2).** If **∀i∈U, Aᵢ(s)=1** and all group floors pass, then the **do-nothing** mechanism **E=∅** maintains s (no one is working against s), hence **c(∅)=0** is attainable.

**Floors (A3).** Each group floor **Gᵍ(s)∈{0,1}** is a non-negotiable predicate. Floors compose by **min** with Φ and never replace any **Aᵢ**.

These are the operational commitments already stated in the body (§5–§6): they fix *what we mean* by “upkeep,” “live veto,” and “content-preserving.”

---

## B.2 Immediate Non-Contradiction Lemma

**Lemma 1 (Immediate).** If **∃i∈U with Aᵢ(s)=0**, then **L(s)>0**.

**Proof.** Let **I₀ = {i : Aᵢ(s)=0}**, nonempty by hypothesis. By A1, for every **i∈I₀** and every content-preserving **E** that keeps s true, **c(E) ≥ cᵢ(s) > 0**. Hence **c(E) ≥ minᵢ cᵢ(s) > 0** for all such **E**. Taking the infimum over **E** yields **L(s) ≥ minᵢ cᵢ(s) > 0**. ∎

**Intuition.** A standing **A** (“this should happen”) alongside some agent’s **¬A** (“this should not happen”) is a *living contradiction*. Keeping both “true” demands continuous work somewhere; with props removed, that work cannot be zero.

---

## B.3 Zero-Load Unanimity and the Main Theorem

**Lemma 2 (Zero-load under unanimity).** If **∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1** and **∀g, Gᵍ(s)=1**, then **L(s)=0**.

**Proof.** With no active vetoes and all floors satisfied, the content-preserving **E=∅** maintains s (A2). Therefore **L(s) ≤ c(∅)=0**; since **L(s) ≥ 0** by definition, **L(s)=0**. ∎

**Theorem 1 (Immediate equivalence at law level).**
With floors included via **min**, for any s:

* **(⇒)** If **∃i, Aᵢ(s)=0** or **∃g, Gᵍ(s)=0**, then **L(s)>0** and **δ(s)=0** at **Θ=1**.
* **(⇐)** If **L(s)=0**, then **∀i, Aᵢ(s)=1** and **∀g, Gᵍ(s)=1**, hence **δ(s)=1** at **Θ=1**.

**Proof.** The first direction combines Lemma 1 with A3 (a failed floor is a standing veto at scale). For the converse, suppose **L(s)=0** yet **∃i, Aᵢ(s)=0**. Then Lemma 1 gives **L(s)>0**, a contradiction. If **∃g, Gᵍ(s)=0**, floors compose by **min**, so admissibility fails regardless of individual acceptance; the no-upkeep assumption again contradicts the need to continuously mask a floor failure. Thus **L(s)=0 ⇒** no live vetoes and all floors satisfied. ∎

**Corollary.** At **Θ=1** (the law), the kernel equivalence holds:

> **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i Aᵢ(s)=1 and ∀g Gᵍ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0.**

---

## B.4 Corollaries: coercion-dependence, metastability, decay

**C1 (Coercion-dependence).** If **∃i, Aᵢ(s)=0** yet s is kept true, the upkeep observed in practice must sit in **L(s)>0**; removing props/pressure (step-down) either (i) drops s (exit) or (ii) reveals positive load.
*Proof.* Lemma 1 gives **L(s)>0** after step-down; if props are fully removed (**E=∅**), either s no longer holds or upkeep becomes visible as failures elsewhere (floor trips), both recorded in receipts. ∎

**C2 (Metastability).** Any **s** with **L(s)>0** is *metastable*: bounded interruptions of enforcement can produce escape from s with positive probability.
*Sketch.* Positive upkeep means a non-zero opposing drift exists; with enforcement paused, some fraction of trajectories exit s. ∎

**C3 (Decay under budget caps).** If the institution cannot sustain **c(E) ≥ c\*** indefinitely while **∃i, Aᵢ=0**, then s cannot persist; it either exits or is redesigned to flip dissent **Aᵢ:0→1**. ∎

---

## B.5 Compositionality proofs

We write Boolean **∧,∨** for pointwise predicates on acceptance, using **0/1** with **min/max** semantics; all results propagate through **Φ** by taking **min** across agents and floors.

### B.5.1 Conjunction (content added)

**Claim.** For any agents i: **Aᵢ(s ∧ t) = min(Aᵢ(s), Aᵢ(t))**. Hence
**Φ(s ∧ t) = min(Φ(s), Φ(t))** and **L(s ∧ t) ≥ max(L(s), L(t))**.

**Proof.** i accepts the package iff i accepts **both** parts; in 0/1 semantics that is **min**. Taking **min** across agents (and then with floors) yields the Φ-rule. Since s∧t contains at least as many obligations as each part, the upkeep cannot decrease. ∎

### B.5.2 Sequencing (paths)

Let **path = s₁ ∘ s₂ ∘ … ∘ sₖ** be a timed composition where each step is contentful.

**Claim.** **Aᵢ(path) = minⱼ Aᵢ(sⱼ)**, hence
**Φ(path) = minⱼ Φ(sⱼ)** and **L(path) ≥ maxⱼ L(sⱼ)**.

**Proof.** i accepts the path only if every step is acceptable—again **min** over steps. Φ follows by agentwise **min** commuting with stepwise **min**; upkeep is bounded below by the largest step upkeep. ∎

### B.5.3 Disjunctions

**(a) Non-individualized choice.** Controller chooses one branch for everyone (or randomness without guarantees).

**Claim.** **Aᵢ(s ∨ t) = min(Aᵢ(s), Aᵢ(t))**, hence **Φ(s ∨ t)=min(Φ(s), Φ(t))**.

**Proof.** Without a per-person guarantee, i must be prepared for either branch; a single unacceptable limb yields a veto, i.e., **min**. ∎

**(b) Certified individualized choice (menus).** Each i is provably assigned a branch **sᵢ ∈ {s,t}** they accept, with **isolation ε≈0** (no cross-branch leakage), rollback **πʳ**, and receipts.

**Claim.** **Aᵢ(s ∨ t | choice) = max(Aᵢ(s), Aᵢ(t))**, hence **Φ(s ∨ t | choice)=max(Φ(s), Φ(t))**.

**Proof.** Given certification, i can secure an acceptable branch; if either limb is acceptable to i, i accepts the menu: Boolean **max**. Floors and isolation constraints are composed separately by **min** with Φ; if they fail, the overall min still blocks δ. ∎

### B.5.4 Contexts (niches, environments)

Let **K** be relevant contexts; write **s|k** the restriction of s in context k.

**Claim.** **Aᵢ(s) = minₖ Aᵢ(s|k)** unless certified isolation to a strict subset of contexts holds (ε≤ε\*). Hence **Φ(s) = minₖ Φ(s|k)** in the pooled case.

**Proof.** Without isolation, agents are exposed to all applicable contexts (now or over time). If any k would be vetoed, i vetoes the pooled s. Certified isolation changes *content* to the selected niche; then evaluate there, logging the isolation proof. ∎

### B.5.5 Floors

**Claim.** With floors **{Gᵍ}**, the overall selector is \**Φ*(s) = min( Φ(s), minᵍ Gᵍ(s) )\*\*.

**Proof.** Floors are additional veto predicates; they can only constrain admissibility and cannot convert any **Aᵢ=0 → 1**. Composition by **min** enforces that. ∎

---

## B.6 Monotonicity and admissible fusion

Let **T** be any aggregation used in lieu of **min** for parts/paths/contexts/floors. We require veto-preservation and safety:

* **T(x,1)=x**, **T(x,0)=0**, **T(x,y) ≤ min(x,y)**, monotone in each argument, commutative, associative.

**Proposition.** Any such **T** is **no larger than min** pointwise; therefore **min** is the least permissive admissible fusion and cannot mask a veto.

**Proof.** The axioms imply that whenever one limb is < 1, **T** cannot exceed that limb; by symmetry it cannot exceed either limb; hence **T ≤ min**. ∎

(Showing **necessity** of **min** among all plausible design desiderata is posed as an open problem §10.4A2; the present proposition is the safety guarantee we use.)

---

## B.7 Frame and timing immunity (for completeness)

If two descriptions s, s′ share the same material-equivalence hash **h(s)=h(s′)**, then by definition they denote the **same content**; any estimator must yield identical **Φ̂** within resolution ε, else the receipt is invalid (§5.5). Timed labels matter only if they change content; otherwise **A, Φ, L** are invariant (§8.4).

---

## B.8 Compact equivalences to reuse

For any family **X** (parts, steps, contexts, floors) and any agent i,

* **Aᵢ(∧ X) = minₓ Aᵢ(x)**, **Aᵢ(∘ X) = minₓ Aᵢ(x)**, **Aᵢ(∨ X | no choice) = minₓ Aᵢ(x)**,
* **Aᵢ(∨ X | individualized choice) = maxₓ Aᵢ(x)**,
* \**Φ(…) = minᵢ Aᵢ(…); Φ* = min(Φ, minᵍ Gᵍ)\*\*,
* **L(…) = 0 ⇔ Φ*(…)=1*\* (after step-down).

These identities, plus Lemma 1 and Theorem 1, are sufficient to replay all structural results in the main text.

# C. Biological Mapping — operational r, q, a, i, e

**Scope.** For a concrete variant **v** in context **k** (cell type, microenvironment, stressor), we estimate the stacked-veto tuple
**r(v,k), q(v,k), a(v,k), i(v,k), e(v,k) ∈ \[0,1]**, then **Φ₍DNA₎(v,k)=min{r,q,a,i,e}** and **Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min\_k Φ₍DNA₎(v,k)** (unless certified isolation, §7.3). Each component returns an **interval** **\[xₗ,xᵤ]** with calibrated uncertainty; **Φ̂** composes by **min** over bounds. Step-down tests (remove props/masks) are mandatory; floors at higher scale (tissue/organism) compose by **min** with Φ (§3.5).

---

## C.1 r — replication/repair fidelity

**Definition (operational).** Probability that DNA replication and repair complete without persistent damage or mutational burden attributable to **v** in **k**.

**Primary proxies.**

* **Mutation rate & spectrum:** fluctuation assays; duplex/error-corrected NGS; barcode lineage accumulation (μ̂).
* **Damage/repair signaling:** γH2AX, 53BP1 foci, pRPA, RAD51, CHK1/CHK2 activation; comet assay.
* **Fork stability:** DNA fiber assays (stalling, restart).

**Scoring (monotone transform).** Map each proxy to \[0,1] against controls; combine by **min** to get **r̂** with band **\[rₗ,rᵤ]** (calibration below).

**Assay notes.** Hypermutators depress **r** broadly; keep background mutagenesis controlled; include temporal windows (early burst vs chronic).

---

## C.2 q — checkpoint passage

**Definition.** Probability of **non-sustained** checkpoint activation during cycle progression with **v** in **k**.

**Primary proxies.**

* **Cell-cycle flow:** EdU/BrdU, pH3; phase fractions (G₁/S/G₂-M).
* **Checkpoint axes:** p53 dynamics, p21/p16 induction, phospho-CHK1/2, ATR/ATM activity.
* **Arrest metrics:** sustained G₁/G₂ arrest beyond τ\* (context-set).

**Scoring.** Normalize each metric to \[0,1]; persistent activation or arrest lowers **q**. Aggregate by **min** ⇒ **q̂ ∈ \[qₗ,qᵤ]**.

**Step-down.** If checkpoint inhibitors were present, **withdraw** them; a true **q=1** call must hold without props.

---

## C.3 a — apoptosis/senescence avoidance

**Definition.** Probability that **v** does **not** trigger persistent apoptosis or senescence programs in **k**.

**Primary proxies.**

* **Apoptosis:** Annexin V/PI, caspase-3/7, TUNEL, mitochondrial depolarization.
* **Senescence:** SA-β-gal, p16/p21 high, SASP cytokines (IL-6/IL-8), persistent DDR foci.
* **Fate tracing:** long-term survival/proliferation after stress pulses.

**Scoring.** Any persistent apoptosis/senescence signal within window τ\* sets **a** via **min**; report **â ∈ \[aₗ,aᵤ]**.

**Notes.** Distinguish transient checkpoint pauses (q) from durable fates (a).

---

## C.4 i — immune compatibility

**Definition.** Probability that **v** avoids **sustained immune targeting/clearance** in **k** (autologous or matched immunity).

**Primary proxies.**

* **Recognition ligands:** MHC-I/II (presentation changes), neoepitope predictions with peptide validation, stress ligands (MICA/B, ULBP), “missing-self”.
* **Cytotoxicity assays:** autologous T/NK co-culture killing, ADCC; interferon response profiles.
* **Immune evasion side-effects:** PD-L1, HLA loss (counts **against** if it compromises system floors).

**Scoring.** Convert recognition/killing to **î ∈ \[iₗ,iᵤ]** (higher kill → lower **i**). If immune evasion degrades organismal immunity, a **floor** (Gᵢᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ) flips to 0.

**Step-down.** Remove immunosuppressants/masks; true **i=1** must persist.

---

## C.5 e — environmental/microenvironmental fit

**Definition.** Probability that **v** operates without degrading local architecture/resources in **k**.

**Primary proxies.**

* **Growth & competition:** relative fitness in physiologic media; barcode competition vs wild-type.
* **Metabolism & stress:** Seahorse OCR/ECAR, glucose/glutamine usage, ROS, hypoxia tolerance.
* **Architecture & barrier:** organoid morphology, ECM adhesion/invasion, TEER (barrier integrity), wound-healing scratch.
* **Paracrine impact:** cytokine/angiogenic factor release; crowding/resource draw.

**Scoring.** Normalize to wild-type envelopes; over-consumption, barrier loss, or disruptive paracrine shifts lower **e** ⇒ **ê ∈ \[eₗ,eᵤ]**.

---

## C.6 Calibration → \[0,1] and bands

**Controls (per context k).**

* **WT/“all-clear”** lines (expected ≈1).
* **Known-deleterious** lines per component (expected ≈0).
* **Rescue** constructs where appropriate.

**Transform.** For each proxy **m**, fix anchor percentiles (e.g., WT p₅→1, deleterious p₉₅→0), then map by a monotone sigmoid; propagate uncertainty via bootstraps to get **\[xₗ,xᵤ]**. Combine within each component by **min**; report the **min-controlling proxy**.

**Coverage.** Validate that true outcomes fall in **\[xₗ,xᵤ]** at rate ≥ τ (report τ).

---

## C.7 Step-down protocols (truthing)

Remove any **props** or **masks** then re-measure:

* **Checkpoint masks:** CDK/CHK inhibitors → withdraw.
* **Immune masks:** immunosuppressants, shielded co-culture → remove/restore competence.
* **Environmental props:** supplements, feeder layers, excessive growth factors → normalize to physiologic ranges.

**Expectation.** Admissible variants (Φ=1) keep **L̂→0**; masked “passes” collapse (Φ falls; **L̂** rises).

---

## C.8 Contexts & isolation

Define contexts **k** (cell types, stressors, immune competence, O₂/ECM). Without certified isolation (**ε≤ε\*** via tracers/seals), **Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min\_k Φ₍DNA₎(v,k)**. Isolation claims must include leakage logs, periodic audits, and rollback **πʳ**.

---

## C.9 Minimal panels by harm class

* **C1 (low).** r (μ̂), q (p53/p21, EdU), a (Annexin), e (growth/TEER).
* **C2.** + i (NK/T co-culture), deeper metabolism, step-down required.
* **C3.** Full r/q/a/i/e with longitudinal tracking, isolation audits, organismal floor probes.
* **C4 (irreversible).** No Θ<1 pilots; admit only if **all** components and floors certify **≈1** with narrow bands.

---

## C.10 Floors at bio scale (compose by min)

* **Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ:** tissue integrity (architecture, function).
* **Gᵒʳᵍ:** organismal viability/health markers.
* **Gᵢᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ:** immune competence intact.
  Any **0** forces **Φ*<1*\* even if cell-local Φ looks high.

---

## C.11 Assay pitfalls & remedies

* **Overexpression artifacts / copy-number.** Use endogenous-level edits; titer match.
* **Off-target edits.** Whole-genome off-target screens; isogenic clones; replicate in independent lines.
* **Clonal drift.** Barcode and mix; analyze at population level.
* **Culture confounds.** Use organoids/physiologic media; confirm in multiple contexts.
* **Batch effects.** Randomize & blind; include technical replicates; spike-in controls.
* **Immune mismatch.** Prefer autologous or HLA-matched systems; document if surrogate.
* **Windowing.** Distinguish transient responses from persistent programs (q vs a).

---

## C.12 Receipt fields for Φ₍DNA₎ runs (to audit)

* **Variant id & h(v)**; contexts **K**; isolation ε logs.
* **Component reports:** for r/q/a/i/e: proxies used, transforms, **\[xₗ,xᵤ]**, min-controlling proxy.
* **Step-down logs:** what was removed, before/after **L̂**.
* **Floors table:** Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ, Gᵒʳᵍ, Gᵢᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ statuses.
* **Decision:** **Φ̂₍DNA₎**, **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, min-controlling layer, δ(v) at Θ, signatures.

---

## C.13 Compact scoring recap

* **Per context:** get **r̂,q̂,â,î,ê** with bands → **Φ̂₍DNA₎(v,k)=min{…}**.
* **Across contexts:** **Φ̂₍DNA₎(v)=min\_k Φ̂₍DNA₎(v,k)** unless certified isolation.
* **With floors:** **Φ\*̂=min(Φ̂₍DNA₎, Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ, Gᵒʳᵍ, Gᵢᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ)**.
* **Decision:** at **Θ=1**, **δ=1** only if **Φₗ=1** and floors pass; else **δ=0** (or Θ<1 sandbox with πʳ).

**Note.** This mapping is **operational**, not “genomic moralism”: it instantiates the stacked-veto form in biology to test the law’s predictions (Φ=1 ⇔ L=0), without declaring genomes a moral authority.

# D. Protocol Specifications — receipts, abstention thresholds, reversibility gates, audit trails

**Scope.** This section standardizes how selectors, boards, and tooling must **decide**, **record**, **audit**, and **replay** δ-decisions. It binds four pillars: (1) receipt formats, (2) abstention/threshold logic, (3) reversibility gates, (4) audit trails and monitors.

---

## D.1 Decision invariants (recap)

* **Law bar:** Θ=1; **δ(s)=1 ⇔ Φ(s)=1 ⇔ ∀i∈U Aᵢ(s)=1 ⇔ L(s)=0** (within resolution ε).
* **Composition:** parts, paths, contexts, floors compose by **min** (or a stricter declared t-norm **T ≤ min**).
* **Domain:** quantifier over **U**; no scope slicing.
* **Framing immunity:** if **h(s)=h(s′)**, then **Φ̂(s)=Φ̂(s′)** within ε.
* **Floors:** group floors **Gᵍ(s)** add constraints; they never flip any **Aᵢ=0 → 1**.
* **Abstention default:** if **Φₗ < Θ** or any floor unverified, **δ=0** (ABSTAINED/PRUNED).

---

## D.2 Receipt format (what every δ must publish)

**Purpose.** A receipt is a self-contained artifact that lets anyone **replay** the decision and confirm the invariants.

* **ABSTAINED:** insufficient evidence (Φᵤ < 1−ε or floors unverified); list missing items.
* **PRUNED:** explicit veto/floor failure; include min-controlling proof.
* **PROVISIONAL (Θ<1):** under live PUW with πʳ; monitoring armed.
* **EXITED:** rollback executed; attach πʳ outcome and restitution.

---

## D.3 Abstention thresholds (Θ, margins, hysteresis)

**Law bar reminder.** **Θ=1** is the non-negotiable law. Any **Θ<1** use is strictly **provisional** under a Provisional Use Warrant with isolation and rollback (§5.2). Hysteresis parameters (Θᵤ, Θₗ) apply **only** within Θ<1 regimes and must be recorded in receipts; they never change the law bar.

### D.3.1 Universal regime (Θ=1)

* **Admit:** if **Φₗ ≥ 1 − ε + m(C)** and **∀g, Gᵍ=1**.
* **Prune:** if **Φᵤ < 1 − ε** or any **Gᵍ=0**.
* **Abstain:** otherwise; enumerate tests/guarantees that would raise **Φₗ**.

**Safety margin m(C).** Set by harm class:

| Class  | Examples                        |    m(C) | Notes                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------: | ------------------------ |
| **C1** | UX tweaks, reversible configs   |   +0.00 | Minimal risk             |
| **C2** | Recommenders, pricing pilots    |   +0.02 | Require πʳ drills        |
| **C3** | Med/infra with non-trivial risk |   +0.05 | Tight floors, isolation  |
| **C4** | Irreversible/serious            | **N/A** | Θ<1 forbidden; Φₗ≈1 only |

### D.3.2 Hysteresis (optional)

* **Enter** when **Φₗ ≥ Θᵤ**; **stay** while **Φₗ ≥ Θₗ**; both logged.
* Prevents flapping; does **not** relax floors or non-manufacture.

### D.3.3 Disjunction mode

* **Default:** non-individualized disjunctions use **min**.
* **Menus:** switch to **max\_with\_individualized\_choice** only with certified per-person assignment, ε≈0 isolation, and receipts proving each chooser can secure an acceptable branch.

---

## D.4 Reversibility gates (πʳ) and PUWs (Θ<1)

### D.4.1 πʳ specification

**πʳ = (pᵣ, cᵣ, tᵣ, scope, triggers, restitution)**

* **pᵣ:** probability rollback succeeds when invoked (target ≥ 0.99 for C2+, ≥ 0.999 for C3).
* **cᵣ:** cost of reversion per person/system (“low/med/high” bound with numeric caps).
* **tᵣ:** latency to fully revert.
* **scope:** exactly what state is reverted (data, artifacts, side-effects).
* **triggers:** metrics/events that auto-invoke πʳ (Φₗ<Θ, floor flip, ε>ε\*, invariance fail, rights incident).
* **restitution:** escrowed compensation/insurance and remediation plan.

**Drills.** Surprise drills at declared cadence; failures force **EXIT** and freeze class until fixed.

### D.4.2 Provisional Use Warrant (PUW) for Θ<1

**PUW fields (minimum):** `theta, scope, caps (N*, T*, R*), πʳ, isolation ε, monitoring cadence, exit triggers, operators, start/expiry`.

* **θ bounds:** Θ<1 must be justified; lower Θ ⇒ tighter caps and faster expiry.
* **No C4 PUWs.** Irreversible classes cannot run under Θ<1.
* **Auto-EXIT:** any breach of caps, πʳ degradation, floor flip, Φₗ<Θ, or invariance failure.

---

## D.5 Audit trails and ledger (tamper-evident history)

### D.5.1 Ledger entries

Each receipt is appended as a **hash-chained** entry:

```
LedgerEntry {
  prev_hash, entry_hash, timestamp, receipt_hash, node_id, signatures[]
}
```

* **Multi-node attestation:** at least two independent nodes sign.
* **Public views:** query PUWs, Θ changes, exits, red-team reports, floor failures.
* **Privacy guards:** store proofs and hashes; sensitive evidence via enclaves or DP summaries.

### D.5.2 What audits verify

* **Replay:** δ deterministically recomputed from receipt.
* **Invariance:** h(s)-stable frames yield identical Φ̂ within ε.
* **Composition:** min (or declared **T ≤ min**) across parts/paths/contexts/floors.
* **Floors:** each **Gᵍ** backed by custodian evidence; conflicts/recusals recorded.
* **Non-manufacture:** step-down ran; Φ̂ did not rely on pressure; **L̂→0** only for admits.
* **PUW hygiene:** all Θ<1 decisions have a live PUW and passed drills.
* **Θ drift:** no off-ledger threshold changes.

---

## D.6 Monitors, alerts, and auto-EXIT

**Always-on metrics (emit to ΦDash):** invariance score, **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** trend, **L̂** (material/informational/institutional), floor sentinels, isolation ε/κ, rollback health (success %, median **tᵣ**, **cᵣ**), Type-I@Θ=1 (target 0), abstention rate, PUW hygiene.

**Auto-EXIT triggers (hard):**

* **Φₗ < Θ** (after smoothing window)
* **Any floor flips to 0**
* **ε or κ exceed caps**
* **Rollback drills fail**
* **Invariance fail with h(s) unchanged**
* **Rights incident above Π threshold**

On EXIT, publish restitution execution and post-mortem to the ledger.

---

## D.7 Evidence bundles and abstention reasons

When **δ=0**, the receipt’s `abstain_reasons[]` must enumerate missing proofs:

* **Coverage:** intervals too wide (Φₗ<Θ, Φᵤ unknown).
* **Floors:** unverified or failing **Gᵍ**.
* **Isolation:** ε not certified; context infimum unresolved.
* **Non-manufacture:** step-down not run or failed.
* **Rollback:** πʳ not proven or drills missing.
* **Composition:** min-proof absent for a limb/path/lottery.

Each reason must point to a **fix-path** (tests, guarantees, redesigns) needed to refile.

---

## D.8 Red-team hooks and receipt lints

**Required suites (with references in `provenance.redteam_refs`):**

* **Framing attack:** paraphrases, ordering, UI labels → **Φ̂** invariant.
* **Lottery/bundle laundering:** min over ∧/∘; disjunction mode correct.
* **Isolation sham:** tracer leakage; ε≤ε\* or bust.
* **Coercion/pressure:** step-down shows no Φ̂ lift; **L̂** spikes under pressure only.
* **Hash games:** semantic drift forces new **h(s)**; no “free” relabel.
* **Paper rollback:** drills succeed; otherwise class frozen.

A **receipt linter** rejects any decision with missing min-step proof, PUW gaps, or invariance failures.

---

## D.9 Floor registry and custodianship (who signs what)

* **Registry:** named floors `{G_rights, G_grid, G_ecol, G_data, G_guard, G_sovereignty, …}`.
* **Custodians:** independent bodies with protocols and drill logs; they sign floor subsections of the receipt.
* **Rotation/recusal:** conflicts published; non-compliant custodians suspend approvals pending external review.

---

## D.10 Minimal APIs (reference tools)

* **hCanon:** `hash = hCanon.canonicalize(s)`
* **ΦKit:** `phi_hat, [phi_l,phi_u], min_ctl = ΦKit.compose(evidence, t_norm="min")`
* **ReceiptKit:** `receipt = build_receipt(...); lint(receipt)`
* **Ledgr:** `append(receipt_hash, prev_hash); verify(chain)`
* **StepDown:** `run(s); Lhat_before_after`
* **IsoProbe:** `epsilon, logs = measure_leakage(setup)`

Outputs must slot into the receipt fields above.

---

## D.11 Compliance checklist (one page)

* [ ] **h(s)** computed; invariance suite passed.
* [ ] **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]** computed with min-composition; **min\_controlling** named.
* [ ] **Floors** certified; custodians’ signatures present.
* [ ] **Step-down** run; **L̂→0** only for true admits.
* [ ] **Isolation ε/κ** audited or pooled **minₖ** used.
* [ ] **Θ=1** by default; if **Θ<1**, **PUW** attached; **πʳ** drills fresh.
* [ ] **Red-team** suite run; exploits none.
* [ ] **Receipt** linted; appended to **ledger** with multi-node attest.
* [ ] **Monitors** armed; auto-EXIT triggers configured.
* [ ] **Abstention reasons** (if δ=0) enumerate fix-paths.

---

**One-line rule.** If you can’t **replay** it, **audit** it, **exit** it safely, and **prove** that framing, lotteries, and force didn’t manufacture Φ—then you can’t do it. Receipts, abstention, reversibility, and ledgers make “Do only that, which would be acceptable to all” a working protocol, not a motto.

# E. Simulation Specs — Φ₍DNA₎ parameter grids, Θ-sweeps, synthetic datasets, analysis outputs

**Goal.** Provide a reproducible spec to (i) stress-test the stacked-veto selector Φ₍DNA₎, (ii) verify **Φ=1 ⇔ L=0** under step-down, (iii) probe Θ-sweeps and context-mix pruning, and (iv) generate falsifiers per §7.5.

## E.1 Experimental factors and knobs

| Block                       | Parameter                | Grid                                                     |

## E.3 Generative model for synthetic datasets

**True component fields.**

1. Draw a 5-dim latent Z \~ N(0, Σ) with Σ off-diagonal ρ ∈ {0, 0.3, 0.6} to set cross-component correlation.
2. Map to base propensities via logistic: x̄ ∈ {r̄, q̄, ā, ī, ē} = σ(α + β⊙Z), rescaled to \[0,1].
3. Apply stressors:

   * r̄ ← r̄ · exp(−λ\_r μ)
   * q̄ ← q̄ · c\_q
   * ī ← ī · c\_i
   * ā ← ā · exp(−λ\_a S)
   * ē ← ē · exp(−λ\_e S)
     with λ\_r,λ\_a,λ\_e ∈ {0.2, 0.5}.

**Mask effects (pre–step-down only).**

* If M\_q=1: observed q̃ = max(q̄, 1−δ\_q) with δ\_q ∈ {0.1, 0.2}; true q̄ unchanged.
* If M\_i=1: observed ĩ lifted similarly with δ\_i.

**Measurement layer.**

* For each component x∈{r,q,a,i,e}:

  * draw proxy m\_x from a noise model (e.g., Beta around x̄ with dispersion k set by σ\_meas),
  * create confidence band \[xₗ,xᵤ] covering τ\_cov using bootstrap or analytic Beta intervals,
  * record min-controlling proxy id.

**Floors.**

* Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ = 1 iff mean architecture score ≥ θᵍ and barrier loss < θᵍ.
* Gᵒʳᵍ = 1 iff aggregated burden B(v) = 1−min\_k Φ₍DNA₎(v,k) stays below θᵍ across library; else 0.
* Gᵢᵐᵐᵘⁿᵉˢʸˢ = 1 unless immune evasion rate > θᵍ or T/NK exhaustion proxy trips.

**Contexts and mixing.**

* Generate K contexts with independent S\_k and competence (c\_q,k, c\_i,k).
* Pooled evaluation: Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min\_k Φ₍DNA₎(v,k).
* Mixed-culture runs introduce ε, κ penalties to q and i in any context where Φ<Θ.

**Load proxy L̂.**

* Define L̂ = L̂\_mat + L̂\_inf + L̂\_ins with channels tied to veto sources:

  * L̂\_mat ∝ 1−r̄ + persistent apoptosis fraction,
  * L̂\_inf ∝ sustained checkpoint/immune signaling,
  * L̂\_ins ∝ external props used (mask strength, staff time).
* After **step-down** (M\_q=M\_i=0 and props=0): recompute L̂; true admits must satisfy L̂→0.

## E.4 Simulation workflows

### E.4.1 DMS fixed-point probe (E1)

1. Select conserved loci; sample |V| variants with single edits.
2. Generate K contexts; compute r,q,a,i,e and Φ₍DNA₎(v,k).
3. Compute Φ₍DNA₎(v)=min\_k; label δ(v) at Θ=1.
4. Step-down: remove masks; recompute bands and L̂.
5. Outputs: Φ histograms (left-skew expected), “cliff” plots ΔΦ vs perturbation, persistence curves f\_v(t) ∝ Φ.

### E.4.2 Context-mix pruning (E2)

1. Pick v with Φ^A≈1, Φ^B<Θ.
2. Run mixes for ε,κ grid; simulate frequency f\_v(t) with penalty term −ε·λ\_B − 𝟙\[floor trip]·Ω.
3. Step-down; measure L̂.
4. Outputs: pruning phase diagram over (ε,κ); f\_v trajectories; load heatmaps.

### E.4.3 Step-down truthing (E3)

1. Run with M\_q/M\_i ∈ {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)}.
2. Remove masks; compare Φ̂, L̂ before/after.
3. Outputs: ΔΦ̂ distributions; L̂ drop-to-zero only for true admits.

### E.4.4 Isolation certification (E4)

1. For variants pruned by context B, enforce isolation with ε targets.
2. Audit ε by tracer; only if ε≤ε\* evaluate Φ on A alone.
3. Outputs: admit rate vs ε; receipt logs showing isolation proofs.

### E.4.5 Load–Φ coupling (E5)

1. Sweep μ and S; record Φ̂ and L̂ time-series.
2. Correlate Φ̂ vs L̂ after step-down.
3. Outputs: monotone curves; only Φ=1 cells achieve L̂≈0.

### E.4.6 Floors dominance (E6)

1. Trip Gᵗᶦˢˢᵘᵉ or Gᵒʳᵍ via burden B(v).
2. Verify Φ\* = min(Φ, floors) blocks δ despite high cell-local Φ.
3. Outputs: admit fraction drop at floor boundary; min-controller attribution to floor.

---

## E.5 Θ-sweeps and phase diagrams

For each grid point:

1. For Θ∈{0.50…1.00}, compute δ(v;Θ).
2. Curves: admit fraction vs Θ; Type-I@Θ=1 (must be \~0), Type-II profile.
3. Phase maps: in planes (μ, c\_q), (μ, c\_i), (ε,κ) plot regions of Φ=1; overlay Θᵤ/Θₗ hysteresis bands.
4. Stability check: run small stochastic shocks to masks and competence; verify admits are robust only inside Φ=1 region.

---

## E.6 Dataset schemas and files

**File naming.** `bench=<E1|E2|…>__gridID=<…>__seed=<####>.parquet`

**Tables (column subsets).**

* `variants.parquet`
  `v_id, locus, perturbation, k_id, r_l,u, q_l,u, a_l,u, i_l,u, e_l,u, phi_l,u, min_controller, masks(M_q,M_i), stepdown(bool)`

* `contexts.parquet`
  `k_id, S, c_q, c_i, epsilon, kappa`

* `floors.parquet`
  `v_id, G_tissue, G_org, G_immunesys, burden_B, floor_trip_reason`

* `decisions.parquet`
  `v_id, theta, delta, label, phi_hat, phi_l, phi_u, Lhat_before, Lhat_after, isolation_cert(epsilon_measured, pass)`

* `receipts.jsonl`
  One JSON per variant decision with fields per §D.2 (min-controlling, step-down logs, floor signatures).

* `provenance.json`
  `schema_version, generator_version, seed, gridspec, timestamp`

---

## E.7 Analysis outputs (expected figures and tables)

**Figures.**

1. Φ histograms per locus (left-skew; razor plateau near 1 for fixed points).
2. “Cliff” plots: ΔΦ vs perturbation magnitude.
3. Admit fraction vs Θ (Θ-sweep curves) with error bands.
4. Phase diagrams:

   * (μ, c\_q) and (μ, c\_i): boundary where Φ=1 emerges.
   * (ε, κ): pruning regions and certified-isolation band.
5. Step-down panels: Φ̂ and L̂ before/after for each mask condition.
6. Load–Φ coupling: scatter and monotone fit (only Φ=1 ⇒ L̂≈0).
7. Floor dominance: admit heatmap with floor overlays; min-controller attribution pie.

**Tables.**

* Type-I admits at Θ=1 (target 0); Type-II by grid.
* Coverage of \[xₗ,xᵤ] by component and context (≥ τ\_cov).
* Invariance checks (frame/order replays) — ΔΦ̂ ≤ ε.
* Isolation audits — failure rates by ε target.

---

## E.8 Pseudocode (reference)

```
simulate_run(gridspec, seed):
  set_rng(seed)
  K ← build_contexts(S, c_q, c_i, ε, κ)
  V ← sample_variants(|V|, loci, perturb_grid)

      stepdown()
      Lhat_sd ← estimate_load(v)
      emit decision rows, receipts
```

---

## E.9 Quality gates (must-pass checks)

* **Type-I@Θ=1 = 0** (no admits with any veto/floor trip in ground truth).
* **Coverage ≥ τ\_cov** for component bands; report mean width.
* **Invariance:** re-frames of the same v,k yield identical Φ̂ within ε.
* **Step-down truthing:** admits keep **L̂→0**; mask-dependent “passes” collapse.
* **Floor fidelity:** any Gᵍ=0 forces δ=0 regardless of cell-local Φ.
* **Isolation honesty:** pooled **minₖ** unless ε≤ε\* certified.

---

## E.10 How to produce falsifiers (for §7.5)

Include seeded scenarios where:

* Masking appears to raise Φ̂ but fails after step-down (should PRUNE).
* Context averaging beats min unless isolation is required (should be caught).
* Floor breaches with high local Φ (must PRUNE).
* Hypermutator with μ≫1 shows low Φ and high L̂ even if individual proxies look “okay” (stacked-veto necessity).

---

## E.11 Packaging and repro

* **Container.** Provide a CLI (`tst-sim run …`) that writes the Parquet/JSON files above and a `replay` command that recomputes δ from receipts.
* **Manifests.** `MANIFEST.toml` with gridspec and seeds; `README.md` mapping outputs to figures.
* **License.** Code: permissive (MIT/Apache) or AGPL per hosting; data: CC-BY-4.0 with ethical-use addendum.

---

**One-line takeaway.** This spec lets any lab generate auditable Φ₍DNA₎ benches, sweep Θ, test isolation and step-down, and verify—on plots and receipts—that **only** variants with **Φ=1** sustain **L→0**, while every manufactured “lift” collapses under truthing.

# F. Objection Catalogue — pluralism, coercive “stability,” hidden dissent, manipulation (with replies)

---

## F.1 “Pluralism makes unanimity impossible”

**Objection.** Reasons are incommensurate and often clash; demanding **∀i∈U, Aᵢ(s)=1** is either empty (never met) or collapses pluralism by forcing a single metric.

**Reply (keep pluralism, change s).**

* **Predicates, not utilities.** TST never cardinalizes persons. **Aᵢ(s)∈{0,1}** stays a reason-tagged predicate; **Φ(s)=minᵢ Aᵢ(s)** preserves each distinct reason (§10.1).
* **Design, not pressure.** Raising Φ requires **changing s**, not changing people: disclosure, compensation/insurance, certified **menus** (individualized disjunction), isolation proofs, reversibility πʳ (§5.2–§5.3, §7.4).
* **Abstention is allowed.** If evidence is unresolved (**Φₗ<Θ**), **δ=0**; no one is forced through averaging (§6.2–§6.3).
* **Floors guard the commons.** Group floors **Gᵍ** (rights, grid, ecology, data) add non-negotiable constraints without overriding anyone’s **Aᵢ** (§3.5, §8.2).
* **Pluralism test (receipt-grade).** Show min-controller (whose reason set the min), list redesigns that would flip **Aᵢ:0→1**, and prove no coercion (§6.4).

**What would refute us.** Find a safe t-norm **T>min** that *never* masks a real veto across parts/paths/contexts/floors (open problem; §10.4A2).

---

## F.2 “Force can make a system stable” (coercive “stability”)

**Objection.** History shows long-lived regimes and orders held by force. Doesn’t that contradict **Aᵢ=0 ⇒ L>0**?

**Reply (load is the measure; remove props).**

* **Definition of stability.** Our stability is **self-sustaining**: **L(s)=0** after *step-down* of props (threats, censorship, subsidies, dark patterns) (§B.1).
* **Living contradiction ⇒ upkeep.** If **∃i, Aᵢ(s)=0**, any content-preserving mechanism pays ongoing material/informational/institutional cost: **L(s)>0** (Immediate Lemma; §B.2).
* **Step-down truthing.** Remove props; a “stable-by-force” state either (i) collapses, or (ii) reveals rising **L̂** (policing, propaganda spend, compliance scaffolds). Either way, it is **not** L=0.
* **Receipts, not slogans.** Ledgers must show step-down traces, **before/after L̂**, and non-manufacture audits. If a regime claims “stability,” it must pass these (§D.2, §D.6).

**What would refute us.** A verified **s** with **∃i, Aᵢ=0** that, *after full step-down and with floors intact*, runs indefinitely with **L(s)=0** (§7.5A1).

---

## F.3 “Hidden dissent makes Φ unmeasurable”

**Objection.** Quiet, absent, or misinformed agents mean we can’t know **Aᵢ**; unanimity becomes unknowable, so δ is paralyzed.

**Reply (conservative uncertainty; build the channel).**

* **Expose ignorance, don’t paper it over.** Unknowns widen bands: report **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**; if **Φₗ<Θ**, **abstain** or run a strictly reversible, opt-in **PUW** with πʳ (§6.2–§6.3).
* **Create access to speak.** Plain-language disclosures, translation, time windows, representation for the absent, and guardianship floors for those without current capacity (§8.2F).
* **Indifference counts.** Truly unaffected agents are **Aᵢ=1** by indifference; you don’t need carve-outs that invite boundary gaming (§2.2, §8.3).
* **Non-manufacture audits.** If dissent appears only when pressure is removed, earlier “assent” was void; receipts must show step-down outcomes (§5.5, §D.8).
* **Ledger & appeals.** Missing standpoints are *abstention reasons* in the receipt; appeals can vacate δ if later evidence shows they were ignored (§9.2D, §D.7).

**What would refute us.** A procedure that (i) keeps **Type-I@Θ=1≈0** while (ii) safely admitting with **T>min** fusion over genuinely missing standpoints without later surfacing vetoes.

---

## F.4 “You can manufacture Φ”: framing, nudges, lotteries, bundling

**Objection.** Change labels, rush timing, dangle incentives, slice into micro-steps, or run a “fair lottery”—and watch “acceptability” rise.

**Reply (framing immunity + composition guards).**

* **Hash the meaning.** Material-equivalence hashing **h(s)** fixes content; if **h(s)=h(s′)** yet **Φ̂** differs beyond ε, the decision is invalid (§5.5, §8.4).
* **Time pressure has no force.** Countdown/urgency doesn’t change content; it only inflates **L̂** and fails non-manufacture (§8.4).
* **Min blocks laundering.**

  * Conjunction & paths: **Φ(s∧t)=min(Φ(s),Φ(t))**, **Φ(path)=min steps**—micro-steps can’t hide a veto (§B.5.1–.2).
  * Disjunctions: without certified individualized choice, **Φ(s∨t)=min**, so “lotteries” don’t raise Φ (§B.5.3).
  * Contexts: pooled evaluation is **minₖ** unless isolation ε≈0 is proved (§B.5.4).
* **Compensation vs bribery.** Legitimate **compensation/insurance** *changes s* (adds enforceable rights/benefits), flipping **Aᵢ:0→1**; **bribes under need or leverage** are coercion and void (§5.3).
* **Receipts make it testable.** Every δ lists min-controlling limb, isolation proofs, step-down logs, and invariance tests (§D.2, §D.8).

**What would refute us.** A demonstrated, durable **Φ̂** increase that (i) survives step-down, (ii) passes invariance with the same **h(s)**, and (iii) doesn’t rely on changing s—i.e., a pure frame that lawfully raises Φ (§7.5B4).

---

## F.5 Cross-cutting quick answers (at a glance)

* **“Unanimity = veto tyranny.”** Only **valid** vetoes count (informed, uncoerced, non-manufactured). Resolution paths are redesign, menus, isolation, compensation—not capitulation (§5.2–§5.3).
* **“Emergencies override.”** Only when “emergency” is **content-true** (a floor at risk). Otherwise it’s framing and fails (§8.4, §9.2G).
* **“Scope to the affected.”** Unnecessary and unsafe: indifferent agents already satisfy **Aᵢ=1**; carving down hides vetoes and raises **L** (§8.3).

---

## F.6 Operator checklist (how to neutralize these failure modes)

* Run **invariance** and **hash** checks (no frame lifts): **h(s) stable ⇒ Φ̂ stable**.
* Enforce **min-composition** across parts/paths/contexts; forbid averaging.
* **Step-down** every claimed gain; watch **L̂** drop only for true admits.
* Require **menus** + certified individualized choice for any disjunction; else evaluate by **min**.
* Treat **unknowns** as uncertainty; **abstain** or **PUW** with πʳ and isolation ε caps.
* Put dissent reasons on the **receipt**; show which redesigns would flip **Aᵢ**.

---

## F.7 Compact formal recap

* **Pluralism-safety:** **Φ(s)=minᵢ Aᵢ(s)**; no cardinalization; floors add by **min**.
* **Coercion-instability:** **∃i, Aᵢ=0 ⇒ L(s)>0** (post step-down).
* **Hidden dissent ⇒ abstention:** unknowns widen **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**; if **Φₗ<Θ**, **δ=0**.
* **Framing immunity:** **h(s)=h(s′) ⇒ Φ̂(s)=Φ̂(s′)**; timing matters only if it changes content.
* **Anti-laundering:** **∧/∘/pooled-contexts ⇒ min**; **∨** uses **min** unless individualized choice is certified.

**Bottom line.** The “hard cases” don’t defeat unanimity; they specify the protocol: conserve plural reasons, refuse frame lifts, measure honestly with bands and step-downs, and change **s**—not people—until **all** can say “yes,” or else don’t do it.

# G. Ethical and Legal Notes — punishability standards, due process, safeguards

## G.1 Lane separation (never blur these)

* **Selection lane (δ):** decides whether s is admissible. It never punishes.
* **Punishability lane (Π):** evaluates culpability for **violations of the selection protocol** (e.g., bypassing δ, manufacturing consent, tampering with floors/ledger). Sanctions move only in this lane, under due process.

**Invariant.** No sanction is lawful if it would itself violate rights floors **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ** or raise **L** by coercion; punishment cannot cure a living contradiction.

---

## G.2 What is punishable (elements) and the Γ test

**Element E1 — a protocol violation.** One or more of:

* Executing s with **δ(s)=0** or without a receipt.
* **Silent Θ drift**; falsifying or omitting a **PUW**; skipping **πʳ** drills.
* **Manufacturing consent** (coercion, dark patterns, essential-needs leverage) proven by step-down drop in Φ̂ or rise in L̂.
* **Composition fraud** (averaging away vetoes; hiding a min-controlling limb; lottery/bundle laundering).
* **Floor tampering** or scope slicing (exclusion of members of **U**; fake isolation ε).
* **Ledger/provenance manipulation** (off-ledger decisions, forged signatures, data-floor breaches).

**Element E2 — culpable mental state.**

* **Knowing** (1.00), **reckless** (0.75), **negligent** (0.50), **innocent error** (≤0.25).

**Element E3 — control and foreseeability.**

* Ability to comply/avoid, foreseeability of breach, ex ante warnings.

**Element E4 — harm class and spread.**

* Map to **C1–C4** (§6.3), number of agents touched, irreversibility, floor impacts.

**Culpability score Γ(o) ∈ \[0,1].** A transparent rubric combining E2–E4, plus **mitigations** (self-report, cooperation, remediation) and **aggravators** (cover-up, repeated breach, profiteering). Publish the rubric.

**Decision rule.**
Sanction only if **(i)** E1 is proven, **(ii)** **Γ ≥ Π**, **(iii)** sanction chosen passes rights floors and proportionality.

---

## G.3 Due-process pipeline (Π-lane)

1. **Notice & charge.** Precise allegation tied to receipts/ledger IDs; plain-language summary.
2. **Disclosure.** Access to evidence, models, h(s), min-controller proofs, red-team logs; protective orders only when a floor would be harmed, with special-master review.
3. **Counsel & assistance.** Right to representation; translation; accessibility.
4. **Neutral forum.** Independent tribunal (Appeals Tribunal, §9.2D) separate from Selector Boards.
5. **Standard of proof.**

   * **Punitive deprivation (liberty/property beyond restitution):** “beyond reasonable doubt.”
   * **Restorative/corrective orders:** “clear and convincing.”
6. **Right to be heard.** Present evidence, question adverse witnesses, call experts, contest models and isolation/step-down procedures.
7. **Automatic stay.** Sanctions are stayed pending appeal, except narrow cases needed to prevent **C4** harm (with written floor justification).
8. **Reasoned decision.** Tribunal issues a **Γ-receipt** (schema below).
9. **Appeal.** Time-boxed; power to vacate, modify, or order restitution.

---

## G.4 Sanction design (restorative-first, proportional, reversible)

**Menu (ordered by priority):**

1. **Restoration/remedy.** Repair harm; compensate affected agents; disgorge ill-gotten gains; fund redress programs.
2. **Corrective controls.** Suspension/decertification of components; mandatory retraining; audited process fixes; external monitors.
3. **Access limits.** Temporary bans from sensitive operations; rate limits; feature freezes.
4. **Civil penalties.** Fines with caps tied to harm class and ability to pay (avoid coercive debt traps).
5. **Criminal penalties (last resort).** Only for willful/reckless violations causing C3–C4 harms or integrity attacks (ledger/floor sabotage).

**Constraints.**

* **Rights floors bind:** no sanction that breaches **Gʳⁱᵍʰᵗˢ** (e.g., no degrading treatment, no arbitrary detention, no compelled speech beyond process needs).
* **No strict liability for ambiguous protocol edges.** Negligent breaches trigger corrective/restorative measures, not punitive ones.
* **Proportionality & necessity.** Choose the least intrusive sanction that achieves restoration, deterrence, and future safety.

---

## G.5 Safeguards against misuse and bias

* **Separation of functions.** SBs (δ) cannot sit on Π cases about their own decisions.
* **Conflict walls & recusals.** Public registry; failure to recuse voids outcomes.
* **Fairness floor.** A **Gⁿᵈ** predicate monitors disparate impact of sanctions; breaches halt the program and trigger review.
* **Whistleblower safe-harbor.** Immunity or leniency for good-faith reporting; anti-retaliation enforcement.
* **Transparency & metrics.** Publish Π statistics: case counts, Γ distributions, sanction types, demographic impact, appeal outcomes.
* **Statutes of limitation.** Time-bounds by harm class, except for ledger/floor sabotage or C4 harms.

---

## G.6 Safe harbors & incentives

* **PUW compliance.** Actions within scope of a valid PUW, with drills passed and exits executed upon triggers, are shielded from punitive sanctions (restorative duties may remain).
* **Self-report & rapid remediation.** Mitigation credit on Γ; reduced penalties when violators disclose early and repair promptly.
* **Red-team bounty.** Lawful probing of invariance/composition/isolation with coordinated disclosure receives reward, not sanction.

---

## G.7 Special cases

* **Children and impaired agents.** Guardianship floors (**Gᵍᵘᵃʳᵈ**) govern; never punish for inability to comply. Target responsible operators.
* **Corporate vs individual liability.** Prefer **institutional** responsibility where control and benefit were institutional; pierce veil only with proof of personal knowing/reckless conduct.
* **Cross-border.** Respect **Gˢᵒᵛ** and **Gⁿᵃ**; mutual legal assistance limited to sanctions that pass rights floors in all relevant jurisdictions.
* **“Emergency” claims.** Only content-true emergencies (floor at risk) justify interim orders; false emergency framing aggravates Γ.

---

## G.8 Γ-receipt (sanctions receipt) — minimal schema

```json
{
  "version":"TST-Π/1.0",
  "case_id":"PI-2025-0918-023",
  "respondent":"Org/Person",
  "allegations":[
    {"code":"Θ-drift","facts":["Receipt S-…","LA log …"]},
    {"code":"Coercion-manufacture","facts":["StepDown ΔΦ̂=-0.07","L̂ spike"]}
  ],
  "violation_found": true,
  "culpability":{
    "mens_rea":"reckless",
    "control":"high",
    "foreseeability":"clear",
    "harm_class":"C3",
    "spread":"broad",
    "mitigations":["self_report","partial_remedy"],
    "aggravators":["benefit_capture"],
    "Γ": 0.78,
    "Π": 0.70
  },
  "sanctions":[
    {"type":"restoration","terms":"Compensate affected class via escrow X"},
    {"type":"corrective","terms":"Suspend feature F; external monitor 12 mo"},
    {"type":"civil_fine","amount":"…"}
  ],
  "rights_floors_check":{"G_rights":1,"G_data":1,"G_nd":1},
  "stay_pending_appeal": true,
  "appeal_window_days": 30,
  "ledger":{"prev_hash":"…","entry_hash":"…","node":"LA/mainnet#2"}
}
```

**Replayability.** Any third party can recompute whether **Γ ≥ Π**, verify evidence provenance, and check that sanctions pass floors and proportionality.

---

## G.9 Compact formal rules (operator crib)

* **Triggering condition:** open Π case when a δ-protocol violation is plausibly alleged.
* **Sanction rule:** impose only if **E1 proven ∧ Γ ≥ Π ∧ rights floors pass**.
* **Proof standards:** punitive = beyond reasonable doubt; otherwise clear and convincing.
* **Priority:** restorative → corrective → restrictive → punitive (last).
* **Appeal stay:** automatic, except to prevent imminent **C4** floor breach.
* **Records:** every step emits a signed Γ-receipt to the ledger.

---

**One-line takeaway.** Selection decides *what may be done*; punishability decides *what to do about cheating*. We punish only with proof, proportionality, rights intact, and a public Γ-receipt—so enforcement itself never becomes a living contradiction.

# H. Reproducibility & Versioning — data, code pointers, hash discipline, update policy

**Goal.** Anyone should be able to **replay** a δ-decision, rebuild figures/metrics, and verify that framing, averaging, or silent Θ drift cannot change outcomes. This section standardizes artifacts, hashing, manifests, environments, and release/version rules.

---

## H.1 Guarantees (what “reproducible” means here)

* **Receipt-replayable:** Given a receipt + referenced evidence, an auditor recomputes **δ(s)** and the min-controller deterministically.
* **Frame-invariant:** Materially equivalent descriptions (same **h(s)**) yield the same Φ̂ within ε.
* **Environment-pinned:** Containers/locks ensure bit-identical runs for code and models.
* **Data-verifiable:** Every dataset has a manifest, file checksums, and a dataset Merkle root.
* **Ledger-auditable:** Each decision/update is hash-linked with time, signers, and prev\_hash.

---

## H.2 Artifact taxonomy (what we ship)

* **Data:** Parquet/JSON per §E.6; `MANIFEST.toml` + SHA-256 per file; Merkle root.
* **Code:** Tools (`hCanon`, `ΦKit`, `ReceiptKit`, `Ledgr`, `IsoProbe`, `StepDown`, `PUWctl`) with pinned deps and container images.
* **Models:** Φ-estimator weights, calibration tables, and commit/tag IDs.
* **Receipts:** δ-receipts and Γ-receipts (sanctions) per §D.2/§G.8; JSONL.
* **Ledger:** Append-only chain (entry hashes + signatures).
* **Notebooks/Pipelines:** Deterministic scripts to rebuild figures/tables.
* **Docs:** CHANGELOG, RELEASE\_NOTES, SCHEMA.md, and a CITATION file.

---

## H.3 Hash discipline (material-equivalence hash h(s))

**Purpose.** Freeze meaning, not phrasing.

**Canonicalization pipeline (deterministic):**

1. **Normalize text:** Unicode NFC; collapse whitespace; lowercase keys; strip comments.
2. **Semantic AST:** Parse proposal into a typed graph: parts, paths (∘), conjunctions (∧), disjunctions (∨), contexts, floors, thresholds, πʳ.
3. **Order rules:**

   * **Contentful order** (e.g., step order in paths): preserve as listed.
   * **Sets** (e.g., contexts when order isn’t content): sort lexicographically by canonical ids.
   * **Disjunction mode** must be explicit (`min` or `max_with_individualized_choice`).
4. **Numeric formatting:** round to 1e−9; fixed decimal; timezone → UTC ISO-8601.
5. **Serialize:** JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) or CBOR canonical form.
6. **Hash:** `h(s) = sha256(canonical_bytes)` as lowercase hex; include a **prefix** `TST-H1:` to bind algorithm version.

**Composite hashes.** Paths/lotteries/contexts add subhashes in their canonical order; the top-level `h(s)` is the Merkle root of limb hashes + metadata leaf (Θ, floors, πʳ ids).

**Rule.** If two artifacts share `h(s)`, any Φ̂ delta > ε is a protocol error; receipts must fail invariance.

---

## H.4 Dataset manifests & checksums

* **Manifest (`MANIFEST.toml`):**

  * `dataset_id`, `schema_version`, `generator_version`, `created`, `license`, `ethics_note`
  * `files[] = { path, sha256, bytes, rows, cols, schema_name }`
  * `merkle_root` (sha256 over file hashes in sorted order)
* **Integrity.** Auditors recompute all SHA-256s and the Merkle root; mismatch ⇒ reject.
* **Provenance.** Record source, DP proofs or enclave attestations; list redactions.
* **Freezing.** Manifests are immutable per dataset version; fixes create a new dataset id.

---

## H.5 Code & environment pinning

* **Versioning:** Semantic versioning for tools (e.g., `ΦKit 0.4.2`).
* **Locks:** `poetry.lock`/`requirements.txt` with exact versions; system packages pinned.
* **Containers:** OCI image with digest (e.g., `sha256:…`); base image digest recorded.
* **Compilers/BLAS/CUDA:** versions logged; flags set for determinism (`CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG`, `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`, etc.).
* **Hardware notes:** CPU/GPU model, core counts; non-deterministic ops disabled or acknowledged in receipts.
* **Build reproducibility:** containerized builds output a SBOM and a build attestation (who/when/what).

---

## H.6 Randomness & seeding

* **PRNG:** PCG64 (or equivalent) with explicit seed.
* **Seed book:** `seeds.json` listing global seed and per-stage seed derivations (`HMAC(seed_global, stage_tag)`).
* **Receipt fields:** store seeds and PRNG type for all stochastic steps.
* **Stochastic tolerance:** specify ε for stochastic reproducibility; report 3× reruns in CI.

---

## H.7 Receipt replay protocol

**Input:** receipt JSON + referenced evidence bundles + tool versions.
**Steps:**

1. Verify ledger link and signatures → fetch prior artifacts if chained.
2. Rebuild canonical **h(s)** and confirm equality.
3. Recompose **Φ̂** using **ΦKit** with min/t-norm exactly as declared; check floor proofs.
4. Recompute **δ** from **\[Φₗ,Φᵤ]**, Θ, margins, hysteresis, and PUW status.
5. Validate **non-manufacture:** confirm step-down logs and **L̂** drop for admits.
6. Emit a **replay report** with pass/fail and diffs; attach to the ledger.

**Rule.** Any replay mismatch triggers ALERT; if unresolved, prior δ is vacated.

---

## H.8 Update policy (semver, compatibility, deprecation)

We version **Specs**, **Tools**, **Datasets**, **Models**, and **Schemas** separately.

* **Spec (text + rules):** `TST-SPEC MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

  * **MAJOR:** breaking changes (e.g., new admissible t-norm family).
  * **MINOR:** backward-compatible additions (new floors/predicates).
  * **PATCH:** clarifications; no behavioral change.
* **Schemas:** `TST-δ/1.x`, `TST-Π/1.x` — bump **MINOR** for additive fields; **MAJOR** if required fields change.
* **Tools:** semver; releases signed and tagged; CHANGELOG with migration notes.
* **Datasets:** date-stamped id + minor: `D-YYYYMMDD.m` (immutable once published).
* **Models:** `Φ-estimator vA.B.C` + weights hash; compatibility matrix with tool/spec versions.

**Deprecation window.** At least 12 months support for N−1 MINOR; 6 months for schema N−1 after a MAJOR release. Ledger enforces rejection of receipts using **unsupported** versions.

---

## H.9 Change management & governance

* **Release checklist:** tests (unit/integration), invariance suite, red-team pack, replay against golden receipts, SBOM/attestation, signatures.
* **Approval:** Selector Board signs tool/spec releases; Ledger Authority publishes on chain.
* **Emergency fixes:** allowed only for security/integrity; narrow scope; post-mortem within 14 days.
* **Public CHANGELOG:** human-readable list of changes with impact labels (breaking/behavioral/none).

---

## H.10 Privacy-preserving reproducibility

* **Class-level proofs:** never store person-indexed assent; keep DP-curated aggregates with ε\_DP budgets recorded.
* **Enclaves:** when raw data are sensitive, provide enclave attestations and deterministic queries with result hashes.
* **Synthetic surrogates:** publish fidelity-attested synthetic datasets alongside private originals.

---

## H.11 Long-term archiving

* **Mirrors:** two independent archives; periodic hash audits.
* **Format durability:** Parquet/JSON + schema registry; avoid exotic formats.
* **Key rotation:** maintain signature chains with cross-certification; keep an emergency recovery plan.

---

## H.12 Common repro failure modes → mitigations

* **Frame drift:** fix with `hCanon`; refuse receipts with `h(s)` mismatch.
* **Silent dep bumps:** containers + lockfiles + SBOM; CI rejects unpinned deps.
* **GPU nondeterminism:** enforce deterministic kernels or fall back to CPU for replay.
* **Clock/timezone noise:** UTC only; fixed time formatting.
* **Floating-point jitter:** fixed precision; tolerance ε disclosed; use Kahan summation where relevant.
* **Data rot:** Merkle-verified mirrors; periodic rehash CI; immutability guarantees for datasets.

---

## H.13 Minimal pointers (expected repo layout)

```
/tools/hCanon/           # canonicalizer + h(s)
/tools/ΦKit/             # Φ algebra, intervals, t-norms
/tools/ReceiptKit/       # build/lint δ & Π receipts

```

Each subproject has: container digest, lockfile, tests, and a `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

---

## H.14 One-page release checklist (must pass)

* [ ] **Hashes:** `h(s)` stable; dataset Merkle root published.
* [ ] **Env:** container digests recorded; locks committed; SBOM + attestation attached.
* [ ] **Receipts:** δ/Γ receipts linted; min-controller named; step-down logs present.
* [ ] **Replays:** golden receipts replay to identical δ; invariance pass ≥ 0.99.
* [ ] **Red-team:** framing/lottery/path/isolation shams caught; no silent Θ drift.
* [ ] **Docs:** CHANGELOG, SCHEMA.md, version pins, compatibility matrix updated.
* [ ] **Ledger:** entries appended with multi-node signatures; prev\_hash linked.
* [ ] **Privacy:** DP/enclave attestations for sensitive data; no person-indexed assent stored.

---

**One-line takeaway.** Reproducibility here isn’t “rerun a script”—it’s a **discipline**: canonicalize meaning, pin environments, hash everything, publish receipts, and version with migration notes—so any competent third party can replay your decisions and verify they obey **“Do only that, which would be acceptable to all.”**
