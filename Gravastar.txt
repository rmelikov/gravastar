Gravastar: Toward a Theory of Everything and the Resolution of the Three-Body Problem

Abstract
We develop a boundary-first, push-gravity framework in which a radiant-entropy field χ with energy density u and flux F is sourced by three fixed supermassive-black-hole anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) and deposits momentum into matter, reproducing Newton’s law with a time-dependent coupling G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t)/c₍χ₎, where Ī(t) = c₍χ₎ ū(t)/(4π). All controllable effects enter a single boundary control 𝒜(t,Ω) in the Robin condition n̂·F − c₍χ₎u = J₍anc₎(t,Ω) − 𝒜(t,Ω); the anchors fix J₍anc₎ and the small anchor-frame anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. A preregistered Nexus ignites at the first time N(t) ≥ N₍c₎ = 25 and J₍eff₎(t) ≥ J₍c₎ with a QND-capacity guard C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎; post-ignition, Ī(t) falls and G₍eff₎(t) ↓ 0 inside a growing domain 𝒟(t) (v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎). Signals comprise a short ignition transient I₍wall₎(t) = Ī(t) + A₍sh₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)/τ₍sh₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎), followed by OU-type decay of anisotropy with time constant τ₍A₎. A solar foil appears only as a weak monopole interaction within 𝒜 (parameter γ; default γ = 0) and is tested by Sun↔Earth lag scans. Mathematically, for Newtonian dynamics with non-increasing G(t) = G₍eff₎(t) and ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞, mutual potential energy tends to zero and trajectories asymptote to free motion in the CM frame, resolving the three-body problem in this regime (and dispersing bounded N-body clusters). Phenomenology remains GR-compatible (PPN γ ≈ β ≈ 1; GW speed = 1; EM constants fixed). A dilaton trace portal realizes universal push without violating the EP, while two UV routes (AS+FN; hidden CFT/AdS) compute λ, {q₍a₎}, C₍χ₎ and recover G₍N₎ pre-ignition. Preregistration centers on four tests: ignition pulse (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎), anisotropy decay (τ₍A₎), c₍χ₎ lag bound, and γ-foil Bayes factor.

1.1 Thesis and setup
Thesis. Gravity is an effective push from a radiant-entropy field χ with energy density u and flux F that is sourced by three fixed supermassive-black-hole anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*). In the near-isotropic limit, momentum deposition into matter reproduces Newton’s law with a time-dependent coupling
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t) / c₍χ₎, where Ī(t) = c₍χ₎ ū(t) / (4π).
All controllable phenomena—Nexus ignition, foils, and any boundary “writes”—enter one dial, a boundary control 𝒜(t,Ω), through a Robin condition that modifies the χ inflow at the celestial boundary.
Setup (minimal postulates and objects).χ-transport (near-isotropic).
∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎(t,Ω) − α(t,x)·u with closure F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂.
J₍anc₎ is fixed by the three SMBH anchors and sets a small anchor-frame anisotropy summarized by {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}.Single boundary dial.
At the boundary, n̂·F − c₍χ₎u = J₍anc₎(t,Ω) − 𝒜(t,Ω).
We work with a low-rank expansion of 𝒜(t,Ω): monopole 𝒜₍00₎, dipole amplitude A₍1₎, and a tri-lobe scalar A₍tri₎. A solar foil is a weak monopole interaction inside 𝒜 (parameter γ; default γ = 0).Push law and Newtonian limit.
Momentum deposition on matter of density ρ is f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)·F.
Averaging over the boundary yields the effective coupling G₍eff₎(t) above; pre-ignition calibration recovers G₍N₎.Ignition and domain growth.
A preregistered Nexus ignites at the first time with N(t) ≥ N₍c₎ = 25 and J₍eff₎(t) = N·j₍0₎·m(t) ≥ J₍c₎, with a QND capacity guard C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎.
Post-ignition, a localized sink turns on, α(t,x) = α₍0₎ + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎, the boundary intensity Ī(t) falls, and thus G₍eff₎(t) ↓ 0 inside a growing domain 𝒟(t) whose front speed satisfies v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎.Signal templates (what we actually look for).
A short ignition transient I₍wall₎(t) = Ī(t) + A₍sh₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)/τ₍sh₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎), followed by OU-type decay of anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} with time constant τ₍A₎. Multi-site lags bound c₍χ₎; Sun↔Earth lag scans test γ.Compatibility and regime of the theorem.
PPN γ ≈ β ≈ 1, GW speed = 1, EM constants fixed, c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.
For Newtonian dynamics with non-increasing G(t) = G₍eff₎(t) and ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞, mutual potential energy vanishes and trajectories asymptote to free motion in the center-of-mass frame, dispersing bound N-body clusters.What follows. Section 1.2 lists contributions; §2 specifies the Nexus and ignition guards; §3–§5 formalize transport and the single-dial boundary calculus; §6–§7 derive the transient/decay templates and propagation constraints; §8–§15 establish GR-compatibility, the three-body resolution regime, and the inference/guardrail program; §16 records the decision logic and receipt fields.

1.2 Main contributions (math, phenomenology, UV, experiments)
Mathematics.Single-dial boundary calculus. We reduce all controllables to one boundary control 𝒜(t,Ω) in the Robin condition n̂·F − c₍χ₎u = J₍anc₎(t,Ω) − 𝒜(t,Ω). A low-rank expansion (monopole 𝒜₍00₎, dipole A₍1₎, tri-lobe A₍tri₎) captures operational degrees of freedom with minimal parameters.Shadowing→Newton map. Momentum deposition f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)·F and near-isotropic closure yield an r⁽−2⁾ force law with G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t)/c₍χ₎, Ī(t) = c₍χ₎ ū(t)/(4π).Ignition fold and templates. Post-ignition signals are captured by two kernels: a short transient K₍sh₎(t) with A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, and an OU decay dA/dt = −A/τ₍A₎ for A ∈ {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}; domain front obeys v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎.Three-body suppression theorem. For Newtonian dynamics with non-increasing G(t) = G₍eff₎(t) and ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞, mutual potential energy U(t) → 0 and trajectories → free in the CM frame; the result extends to dispersion of bounded N-body clusters.State-space & identifiability. A compact state X(t) = [Ī, A₍1₎, A₍tri₎, …] with control U(t) ↦ 𝒜(t,Ω) clarifies what is inferred. The minimal fit set is Θ = { κ, c₍χ₎, τ₍A₎, γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ }.Phenomenology (GR-compatibility and signals).PPN/GW sector intact. PPN γ ≈ β ≈ 1; GW speed = 1; χ contributes as a source only; EM constants fixed; c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.Anchors and anisotropy. Three fixed SMBH anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) determine J₍anc₎ and a small anchor-frame anisotropy summarized by {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}; these decay post-ignition with τ₍A₎.Solar foil as constrained monopole. A weak interaction appears only in the 𝒜₍00₎ channel via γ (default γ = 0); it is tested by Sun↔Earth lag scans consistent with c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.Locality of impact. Domains occupy a tiny volume fraction, keeping cosmology effectively neutral while allowing laboratory detection.UV and microphysical bridge.Trace-portal realization. A dilaton (scale symmetry) trace portal explains EP-safe universality of push without drifting SM constants.Two UV routes that compute constants.
Track A (asymptotic safety + Froggatt–Nielsen) and Track B (hidden CFT/AdS) compute λ, {q₍a₎}, C₍χ₎ and recover G₍N₎ in a pre-ignition calibration.Parameter economy. The one-dial 𝒜(t,Ω) framing keeps UV outputs orthogonal to laboratory fit Θ, simplifying cross-checks.Experiments and inference (preregistered).Ignition rule with QND guard. First time N(t) ≥ N₍c₎ = 25 and J₍eff₎(t) = N·j₍0₎·m(t) ≥ J₍c₎, plus C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎.Four core tests. (i) Ignition pulse: estimate A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ across SCG/torsion/clock channels; (ii) Anisotropy decay: τ₍A₎ via OU fits; (iii) Propagation: c₍χ₎ bound from multi-baseline lags; (iv) Solar foil: Bayes factor for γ ≠ 0 via Sun↔Earth τ-scan.Global hierarchical fit. Inference on Θ with informative priors (γ centered at 0, A₍sh₎ ≥ 0, log-uniform τ₍sh₎); evidence via posteriors, Bayes factors, and LOO/WAIC; guardrails battery (PPN/GW/EM/cosmology/composition) applied unchanged.Receipt & reproducibility. Decision logic records {γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎}, model hashes, instrument windows, and preregistration artifacts for independent replication.1.3 Falsifiability posture (frozen thresholds; one-dial boundary control; solar foil γ = 0 by default)
Principle. Every claim in this paper is tied to a preregistered knob, datum, or inequality. No post-hoc tuning. The only adjustable physics input at the boundary is a single control 𝒜(t,Ω); all other quantities are fixed or inferred under preregistered priors.
Frozen structure (cannot be retuned).
(1) Anchors: (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) fix J₍anc₎(t,Ω) and the small anchor-frame anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}.
(2) Ignition rule: first t with N(t) ≥ N₍c₎ = 25 and J₍eff₎(t) = N·j₍0₎·m(t) ≥ J₍c₎, plus QND capacity C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎ over the ignition window.
(3) Boundary control: n̂·F − c₍χ₎u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜(t,Ω); low-rank 𝒜 with monopole 𝒜₍00₎, dipole A₍1₎, tri-lobe A₍tri₎.
(4) Solar foil: encoded only in the monopole via parameter γ, with default γ = 0 (null).
(5) Calibration & guardrails: pre-ignition recovers G₍N₎; PPN γ ≈ β ≈ 1; GW speed = 1; EM constants fixed; c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.
Observable commitments (what must show up, if the model is right).
After a valid ignition (as above):
• Transient pulse: I₍wall₎(t) = Ī(t) + A₍sh₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)/τ₍sh₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎) with A₍sh₎ ≥ 0.
• Secular isotropization: OU-type decay dA/dt = −A/τ₍A₎ for A ∈ {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}, i.e., finite τ₍A₎ and A → 0 in time.
• Causal propagation: multi-site arrival lags consistent with c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.
• Solar foil test: Sun↔Earth lag scan consistent with γ = 0 unless data strongly favor γ ≠ 0.
Four preregistered tests (and decision thresholds).
T₍1₎ Ignition pulse: joint fit of (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎) across SCG/torsion/clock channels; claim if P(A₍sh₎ > 0 | data) ≥ 0.95.
T₍2₎ Anisotropy decay: estimate τ₍A₎ from OU fits of {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}; claim if P(τ₍A₎ < τ₍A,max₎ | data) ≥ 0.95 (τ₍A,max₎ preregistered).
T₍3₎ Propagation speed: posterior on c₍χ₎ from cross-site lags; claim if P(c₍χ₎ < 1 | data) ≥ 0.95.
T₍4₎ Solar foil: Bayes factor BF₍γ≠0:γ=0₎ from Sun-locked τ-scan; claim if BF ≥ 10 (else report tightened upper bound on |γ|).
What would falsify the framework (any single item suffices).
F₍1₎ Pre-ignition drift: statistically significant θ₍G₎(t) or anisotropy changes before a valid ignition (violates operational trigger).
F₍2₎ No post-ignition response: after a valid ignition, A₍sh₎ ≈ 0 and no OU-type decay (τ₍A₎ → ∞) within the preregistered window.
F₍3₎ Acausal propagation: required lags imply c₍χ₎ > 1 or are mutually inconsistent across baselines.
F₍4₎ Guardrail breach: deviations from PPN γ ≈ β ≈ 1, GW speed ≠ 1, or detectable EM-constant drift attributable to 𝒜(t,Ω).
F₍5₎ Cosmology spillover: a required volume fraction f₍V₎ that cannot be kept ≪ 1 while fitting lab signals (breaks locality neutrality).
F₍6₎ Unmodelable solar lock-in: a strong Sun-locked response that cannot be captured by a small monopole γ inside 𝒜 without violating guardrails or priors.
F₍7₎ Monotonicity failure: post-ignition G₍eff₎(t) exhibits a persistent increase inconsistent with the sink α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎ (beyond registered noise models).
Statistical discipline.
Priors on Θ = { κ, c₍χ₎, τ₍A₎, γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ } are preregistered (γ centered at 0; A₍sh₎ half-normal; τ₍sh₎ log-uniform). Evidence is reported via posteriors, Bayes factors (for γ), and LOO/WAIC. Multiplicity is handled by a fixed analysis plan; no subset cherry-picks.
Receipts & replication.
Decision packets record {γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎}, model hashes, instrument windows, and raw+processed data links. Nulls are publishable; any guardrail breach or F₍1₎–F₍7₎ triggers a fail with constrained alternatives logged.

1.4 Roadmap and notation pointer
Roadmap. The paper proceeds from operational definitions to transport, boundary control, signals, compatibility, theorem, and tests:§2 (Operational core). Defines the Nexus, drive J₍eff₎(t) = N·j₍0₎·m(t), the ignition rule (N₍c₎ = 25, J₍c₎), and the QND-capacity guard C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎.§3 (χ transport & sources). Puts the near-isotropic transport ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎ − α·u and closure F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂; anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) fix J₍anc₎ and the small anchor-frame anisotropy summarized by {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}.§4 (Push → Newton). Derives G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)/c₍χ₎ with Ī(t) = c₍χ₎·ū/(4π); pre-ignition calibration → G₍N₎.§5 (Boundary-first). Collapses all controllables into one dial 𝒜(t,Ω) via the Robin condition n̂·F − c₍χ₎u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜; we use a low-rank expansion (monopole 𝒜₍00₎, dipole A₍1₎, tri-lobe A₍tri₎).§6–§7 (Ignition & propagation). Post-ignition signals = a short transient I₍wall₎(t) with {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎} and OU decay of {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} with τ₍A₎; lags bound c₍χ₎; a Sun↔Earth τ-scan tests the monopole foil γ (default γ = 0).§8 (Compatibility). PPN γ ≈ β ≈ 1; GW speed = 1; EM constants fixed; χ is a source only.§9 (Three-body). Proves: if G(t) = G₍eff₎(t) is non-increasing and ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞, then U(t) → 0 and trajectories → free (CM).§10–§13 (Locality, thermo, SM bridge, UV). Keep cosmology neutral (small f_V), retain BH/thermo guardrails, realize push via a trace portal, and present two UV routes that compute {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎}.§14–§16 (Predictions, inference, receipt). Four prereg tests (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎; τ₍A₎; c₍χ₎ lag; γ Bayes factor), global fit on Θ = {κ, c₍χ₎, τ₍A₎, γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎}, guardrails battery, and the ToE receipt fields.Appendices. Full derivations (transport, shadowing, PPN/GW), the three-body proof, inference math, and Adamas 1D as an optional engineering appendix.Notation pointer (house style). Full policy is in §0.4; essentials here:Delimiters. ( ) for functions, tuples, open intervals, and prose clarifications; [ ] for closed/half-open intervals; { } for sets.Superscripts/subscripts (prose/math). Use ⁽ ⁾ and ₍ ₎ only: e.g., G₍eff₎, Ī, c₍χ₎, A₍1₎, A₍tri₎, τ₍A₎. (No ASCII x^2 or x_i.)Vectors & frames. Bold 3-vectors (F); unit vectors with hats (n̂). Frames: EF/JF/AF/LF.One-dial control. 𝒜(t,Ω) is the only adjustable boundary input; the anchors determine J₍anc₎(t,Ω).Shorthand. θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎; domain indicator 1₍𝒟(t)₎; ignition time t₍ign₎.Readers who want a compact schema of the inference pipeline can jump to §15.1 (state-space summary) and §16.2 (receipt fields).

2.1 Source registers and global state (ρ₍N₎; windowing)
Members and Hilbert spaces. The Nexus comprises a time-varying active set 𝒮₍act₎(t) of N(t) members. Member k is modeled on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space ℋ₍k₎ (qubit by default; higher d₍k₎ allowed). The composite space at time t is ℋ₍N₎(t) ≡ ⊗₍k∈𝒮₍act₎(t)₎ ℋ₍k₎. The global quantum state on ℋ₍N₎(t) is ρ₍N₎(t), generally mixed due to local noise and coarse-graining.
Windows and clocks. Analyses run on non-overlapping challenge windows Γᵢ ≡ [t₍0,ᵢ₎, t₍0,ᵢ₎+τ], with τ preregistered. Timestamps use the laboratory frame (LF) clock with accuracy δt₍clk₎, recorded in the ledger. Within a window we treat N, device settings, and priors as frozen; across windows they may update per prereg rules.
Active-set rule. A member k is active in Γ if (i) device uptime ≥ u₍min₎, (ii) calibration residuals below r₍max₎, and (iii) data completeness ≥ c₍min₎. The active set 𝒮₍act₎(Γ) fixes N(Γ)=|𝒮₍act₎(Γ)| and the tensor factors of ℋ₍N₎. Dropouts inside Γ are handled by trace-out: if k fails mid-window, we evolve ρ₍N₎ → Tr₍k₎ ρ₍N₎ and mark the event.
Local channels and independence. Over a small step Δt inside Γ, member k experiences a completely positive, trace-preserving map Λ₍k,Δt₎ (dephasing, amplitude damping, or a calibrated mixture). To first order,
ρ₍N₎(t+Δt) ≈ ⊗₍k∈𝒮₍act₎₎ Λ₍k,Δt₎[ρ₍N₎(t)],
with cross-member couplings bounded by independence audits (recorded separately in §2.7). This factorized-noise assumption is operational (audited), not axiomatic.
Classical registers and estimates. Each member yields a classical record stream R₍k₎(t) (settings, outcomes, quality flags). From {R₍k₎} on Γ we build:a superposition score 𝒞₍k,Γ₎ (defined in §2.2),the order parameter m(Γ) from aggregated expectation values (defined in §2.4),the witness inputs for the asynchronous entanglement test (defined in §2.3).These are windowed summaries; the underlying estimator ρ̂₍N,Γ₎ is the maximum-likelihood (or Bayesian) state compatible with {R₍k₎} under Λ₍k,Δt₎ and the independence bounds. We use ρ̂₍N,Γ₎ only to compute windowed scalars (𝒞₍k,Γ₎, m(Γ), witness statistics); it is not carried forward between windows.
Drive and aggregation. The effective drive in Γ is
J₍eff₎(Γ) ≡ N(Γ)·j₍0₎·m(Γ).
Ignition logic (first-hit of N ≥ 25 and J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎ with C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎) is evaluated per window using these aggregated quantities.
Window hygiene and reproducibility. Each Γ has a signed ops card: device versions, Λ₍k₎ model IDs, δt₍clk₎, calibration hashes, RNG attestations, membership list 𝒮₍act₎(Γ), and exclusions. All scalar outputs (N, 𝒞₍k,Γ₎, m(Γ), J₍eff₎(Γ)) reference that card to guarantee repeatable recomputation.
Why windowing. Windows ensure (i) stable device priors, (ii) stationary noise modeling inside Γ, (iii) clean causal alignment with external channels (χ-sector regressors, §6–§7). This keeps the Nexus layer strictly operational and auditable while feeding the boundary-control inference downstream.

2.2 Superposition metric and thresholds
Goal. Certify, per window Γ, that each active member k sustains non-classical superposition—separately from entanglement—using a simple, auditable score 𝒞₍k,Γ₎ ∈ [0, 1] with preregistered pass/fail gates.
Protocol (windowed, randomized axes).
Within Γ, each member k is measured along a randomized sequence of Pauli axes 𝕌 ≡ {x, y, z} with hidden phases; per shot i on axis a ∈ 𝕌 the binary outcome y₍i₎ ∈ {−1, +1} is recorded. Let M₍a₎ be the number of shots on axis a. The empirical Bloch components are
r₍a,k,Γ₎ ≡ (1/M₍a₎) ∑ y₍i₎  for a ∈ {x, y, z}.
Collect these into the Bloch 3-vector r₍k,Γ₎ with components (r₍x,k,Γ₎, r₍y,k,Γ₎, r₍z,k,Γ₎).
Single-qubit superposition score (transverse coherence).
Define the transverse magnitude (relative to the drive axis z)
r₍⊥,k,Γ₎ ≡ √( r₍x,k,Γ₎⁽2⁾ + r₍y,k,Γ₎⁽2⁾ ).
To remove finite-sample bias, estimate the null bias b₍k,Γ₎ by label-shuffling (or permutation) within Γ, and form a debiased, clipped score
𝒞₍k,Γ₎ ≡ clip₍0→1₎( r₍⊥,k,Γ₎ − b₍k,Γ₎ ).
Here clip₍0→1₎(x) ≡ min(1, max(0, x)). For qubits with mild SPAM errors this equals the usual coherence √(ρ₍01₎ρ₍10₎) up to known affine corrections; for higher d we restrict to the encoded qubit subspace (logged in the ops card).
Quality gates (per member, per window).
A member k is eligible in Γ only if all hold:Sampling: M₍x₎, M₍y₎, M₍z₎ ≥ M₍min₎ (preregistered); data completeness ≥ c₍min₎.Stationarity: residuals under a constant-mean model on each axis pass a preregistered stationarity test (e.g., no linear drift beyond r₍max₎).Null control: the permutation p-value p₍FP,k,Γ₎ for r₍⊥₎ exceeds its shuffled median by ≥ z₍₎ standard deviations (equivalently, p ≤ α₍sup₎). The pair (α₍sup₎, z₍₎) is preregistered.Thresholds (member-level and window-level).
A member passes the superposition test in Γ if
(i) 𝒞₍k,Γ₎ ≥ 𝒞₍min₎ and (ii) p₍FP,k,Γ₎ ≤ α₍sup₎.
Let 𝒫₍Γ₎ ≡ { k ∈ 𝒮₍act₎(Γ) : pass }. Define the coverage
S₍Γ₎ ≡ |𝒫₍Γ₎| and the coverage fraction f₍Γ₎ ≡ S₍Γ₎ / N(Γ).
The window passes superposition if S₍Γ₎ ≥ S₍min₎. By default we set S₍min₎ = N₍c₎ to align with ignition (frozen), but alternative S₍min₎ may be preregistered if N(Γ) > N₍c₎.
Link to the order parameter and drive.
The order parameter m(Γ) used in J₍eff₎(Γ) = N(Γ)·j₍0₎·m(Γ) is estimated from longitudinal expectation values using only the passing members:
m(Γ) ≡ (1/S₍Γ₎) ∑₍k∈𝒫₍Γ₎₎ ⟨σ₍z₎⟩₍k,Γ₎,
with a preregistered shrinkage toward zero set by the null variance of ⟨σ₍z₎⟩. Members that fail the superposition gate contribute nothing to m(Γ) in that window. This ensures J₍eff₎ cannot be inflated by classical mixtures.
Robustness and adversarial controls.Axis randomization: per-shot axes and phases are derived from a public randomness beacon; seeds and draws are logged in the ledger to defeat replay.Jackknife stability: report jackknife spans for 𝒞₍k,Γ₎; a span exceeding a preregistered bound flags the member.Device bias audit: per-device SPAM parameters are estimated in calibration windows and propagated as affine corrections to r₍k,Γ₎ (hashes recorded).Outputs recorded per window Γ.
For each k: {𝒞₍k,Γ₎, p₍FP,k,Γ₎, pass/fail, M₍x₎, M₍y₎, M₍z₎}.
For the window: {S₍Γ₎, f₍Γ₎, m(Γ), J₍eff₎(Γ)} together with the ops-card hash linking to device models and random seeds.
Rationale. 𝒞₍k,Γ₎ isolates single-register coherence (superposition) with explicit finite-sample control and without assumptions about cross-member coupling (which is tested separately in §2.3). Tying m(Γ) to passing members makes the ignition rule operationally falsifiable and resistant to classical or low-quality contributions.

2.3 Asynchronous entanglement witnesses (W₍N₎, B₍N₎)
Purpose. Within each window Γ we certify multipartite entanglement under real-world asynchrony (unsynchronized clocks, variable latencies) using a lag-tolerant protocol. We report a witness value W₍N,Γ₎ and a separable bound B₍N,Γ₎; entanglement is claimed if W₍N,Γ₎ > B₍N,Γ₎ by a preregistered margin with controlled false positives.

2.3.1 Data primitives and cohorting (lag tolerance)
Shots. Member k produces shots s₍k,i₎ = (t₍k,i₎, a₍k,i₎, y₍k,i₎), with timestamp t (LF), axis a ∈ {x, y, z} chosen from a public randomness beacon, and outcome y ∈ {−1, +1}. All seeds and draws are logged.
Lag window and tolerance. Fix a coincidence tolerance w ≤ Δ₍max₎ (both preregistered). We form cohorts 𝒞 by greedy matching: each cohort contains at most one shot per active member with |t₍k,i₎ − t₍ℓ,j₎| ≤ w for all included pairs. Unmatched shots are discarded for entanglement analysis but remain in superposition metrics (§2.2).
Setting patterns. For each cohort c we derive a pattern label λ₍c₎ from the beacon (hash of cohort IDs) that maps members to local axes f₍λ₎(k) ∈ {x, y, z}. Only cohorts that satisfy a required pattern (e.g., all-in-x, all-in-y, or a balanced mix) contribute to the parity witness below; all cohorts contribute to pairwise Bell scores.

2.3.2 Two complementary witnesses
We use a pairwise Bell matrix to localize and a multipartite parity witness to certify depth. Both operate on the same cohorts.
(a) Pairwise Bell matrix (asynchronous CHSH aggregation)
For each ordered pair (k, ℓ) and each cohort c containing both k and ℓ, define the pair-correlator
C₍kℓ,c₎ ≡ y₍k,c₎·y₍ℓ,c₎·σ₍kℓ,c₎,
where σ₍kℓ,c₎ ∈ {−1, +1} is a deterministic sign computed from the axes in cohort c to implement the CHSH-like contrast (the mapping from axis pairs to signs is preregistered and beacon-derived). Aggregate with bias control:
B₍kℓ₎ ≡ mean₍c∈𝒞₍kℓ₎₎(C₍kℓ,c₎) − b₍kℓ₎,
where b₍kℓ₎ is the permutation-bias estimate (axis labels shuffled within members). Assemble the Bell matrix 𝔅 with entries B₍kℓ₎ (B₍kk₎ = 0). Define
W₍Bell₎ ≡ λ₍max₎(sym(𝔅)),
the largest eigenvalue of the symmetrized matrix. Large positive W₍Bell₎ indicates widespread pairwise nonclassical correlations.
(b) Multipartite parity witness (randomized Mermin-style)
For each parity-eligible cohort c (pattern λ₍c₎ satisfied), define the parity
Π₍c₎ ≡ ∏₍k∈c₎ ( y₍k,c₎·τ₍k,λ₍c₎₎ ),
where τ₍k,λ₎ ∈ {−1, +1} is a precomputed sign table (beacon-derived) that alternates patterns across cohorts to avoid bias. Average over parity-eligible cohorts:
W₍par₎ ≡ mean₍c∈𝒞₍par₎₎(Π₍c₎).
Intuition: for separable models with randomized axes, Π averages to a small value; persistent positive parity across randomized patterns signals genuine multipartite correlations.
Combined witness
We define the asynchronous entanglement witness
W₍N,Γ₎ ≡ α₍Bell₎·𝑧(W₍Bell₎) + α₍par₎·𝑧(W₍par₎),
where 𝑧(·) rescales each component to zero-mean, unit-variance under the null (see below), and {α₍Bell₎, α₍par₎} are fixed weights (α₍Bell₎ = α₍par₎ = 1 by default). This combination increases power across device mixes.

2.3.3 Separable bound B₍N,Γ₎ and false-positive control
We construct asynchronous separable nulls that preserve all within-member statistics and latencies while breaking cross-member quantum correlations:Lag-scramble null. Circularly shift each member’s timestamps by an independent shift > Δ₍max₎; keep axes and outcomes aligned to original shots.Axis-resample null. Resample axes within each member from its empirical axis distribution; keep timestamps and outcomes.Sign-flip null. Flip outcomes y₍k,·₎ with independent, member-specific random signs to destroy fixed parities.For R₍null₎ replicates per null family we compute W₍N,Γ₎ and take the separable bound
B₍N,Γ₎ ≡ quantile₍1−α₍ent₎₎( {W₍N,Γ₎}₍null₎ ),
with α₍ent₎ preregistered (e.g., 0.01). We claim entanglement in Γ if
W₍N,Γ₎ ≥ B₍N,Γ₎ + δ₍ent₎,
where δ₍ent₎ is a preregistered margin that compensates for multiplicity and estimator bias. The same null bank yields 𝑧(·) for component standardization.

2.3.4 Depth certification (≥ d-partite)
To certify entanglement depth ≥ d, we evaluate the parity witness on random d-sized subsets 𝒮 ⊂ 𝒮₍act₎(Γ) (a preregistered number per d). For each 𝒮 we form W₍par,𝒮₎ and its subset-specific bound B₍d,Γ₎ using the same null bank restricted to 𝒮. We declare depth ≥ d if max₍|𝒮|=d₎ W₍par,𝒮₎ ≥ B₍d,Γ₎ + δ₍depth₎ and control the family-wise error via Benjamini–Hochberg (α set in preregistration). Depth reporting is d₍max₎ with q-values.

2.3.5 Robustness, loopholes, and auditsAsynchrony robustness. Cohorts tolerate bounded clock skew; w and Δ₍max₎ are chosen from calibration data and locked in preregistration. A separate clock-jitter audit is run per window; failures disqualify Γ from entanglement claims.Independence audits. No member-to-member classical side channels: we log physical isolation tests and spectrum scans (§2.7). Any flagged link voids entanglement claims for that Γ.Beacon integrity. All setting choices and pattern labels derive from a public randomness beacon; seeds and draws are hashed in the ledger.Device heterogeneity. The combined witness remains valid when members differ (qubit platforms, latencies), because the nulls preserve each member’s marginals and time structure.Adversarial resilience. The null bank (lag-scramble, axis-resample, sign-flip) collectively defeats replay, axis-bias, and parity-lock strategies.2.3.6 Outputs, thresholds, and linkage to ignition
Recorded per window Γ.
W₍Bell₎, W₍par₎, W₍N,Γ₎, B₍N,Γ₎, p-value p₍ent,Γ₎, depth d₍max,Γ₎ with q-values; cohort counts; w, Δ₍max₎; null replicates R₍null₎ and hashes.
Pass criteria.
Entanglement passes if W₍N,Γ₎ ≥ B₍N,Γ₎ + δ₍ent₎ and p₍ent,Γ₎ ≤ α₍ent₎, with clock and independence audits green.
Ignition linkage.
Passing entanglement in Γ contributes to the QND capacity C₍QND₎(τ) (reported in §2.5) and permits inclusion of the corresponding members in the order-parameter m(Γ) used in J₍eff₎(Γ) = N·j₍0₎·m(Γ). Failure of entanglement does not veto superposition (§2.2) but prevents the window from satisfying the full ignition guard.

2.4 Drive mapping: J₍eff₎(t) = N·j₍0₎·m(t)
Purpose. Convert per-member quantum performance (from §2.2–§2.3) into a single, auditable drive scalar that gates ignition and determines the strength of the boundary control 𝒜₍00₎(t) post-ignition.

2.4.1 Definitions and unitsSingle-member scale j₍0₎. A fixed, preregistered conversion from one fully-passing member to a unit of effective drive. Units match the monopole component of boundary control (same column as 𝒜₍00₎). We keep j₍0₎ explicit to preserve comparability across hardware revisions.Order parameter m(t). A dimensionless alignment factor in [−1, 1] summarizing the passing members’ longitudinal expectations within the current window Γ.Effective drive. J₍eff₎(t) ≡ N(t)·j₍0₎·m(t). It is evaluated window-wise as J₍eff₎(Γ) with timestamps taken at the window midpoint.2.4.2 How m(Γ) is computed (and who counts)
Within a window Γ:Eligibility. Members must pass both the superposition gates of §2.2 (𝒞₍k,Γ₎ and p₍FP,k,Γ₎) and the audits linked to the asynchronous entanglement protocol of §2.3 (clock/independence beacons green). Failure excludes the member from m(Γ).Aggregate over passers only.
Let 𝒫₍Γ₎ be the set of passing members with size S₍Γ₎. Define
m(Γ) ≡ (1/S₍Γ₎) ∑₍k∈𝒫₍Γ₎₎ ⟨σ₍z₎⟩₍k,Γ₎.
We apply a preregistered shrinkage toward 0 based on the null variance of ⟨σ₍z₎⟩ to avoid inflating J₍eff₎ under noise. Members that do not pass contribute nothing.Sign discipline. The drive direction (sign of m) is fixed by a public convention (e.g., “+z” equals the lab’s reference orientation). If instrumentation flips that convention in a window, we record it and flip all affected ⟨σ₍z₎⟩ before aggregation (hash logged).Stability (elasticity index). We compute S₍el,Γ₎ ≡ 1 − var₍block₎(⟨σ₍z₎⟩₍k,Γ₎)/var₍shot₎(⟨σ₍z₎⟩₍k,Γ₎) as a 0–1 stability score; a floor S₍el,Γ₎ ≥ S₍el,min₎ is required to call m(Γ) informative. The index is reported, not multiplied into m, to keep J₍eff₎ interpretable.2.4.3 Ignition logic (first-hit) and guardsRule. Window Γ triggers ignition if N(Γ) ≥ N₍c₎ = 25, J₍eff₎(Γ) ≥ J₍c₎, and the QND capacity satisfies C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎ (from §2.5). The first such Γ defines t₍ign₎.No partial credit. If any guard fails, the window is non-igniting regardless of J₍eff₎. Guards are frozen in preregistration.2.4.4 Mapping drive to the boundary dial 𝒜₍00₎(t)
We connect operational drive to boundary control by a preregistered, monotone causal response ℛ₍Nx₎:Pre-ignition. 𝒜₍00₎(t) = 0.Post-ignition (t ≥ t₍ign₎).
𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎( J₍eff₎(t) ), with ℛ₍Nx₎ non-decreasing, Lipschitz, and saturating:ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍c₎) = A₍on₎ (onset level),ℛ₍Nx₎(J) → A₍max₎ as J → ∞,dℛ₍Nx₎/dt is supported only after t₍ign₎ (causality).
A default choice is soft-step:
ℛ₍Nx₎(J) = A₍max₎·[ 1 − exp( −(J − J₍c₎) / J₍s₎ ) ]₍+₎,
where [·]₍+₎ ≡ max(·, 0) and J₍s₎ controls slope. The pair (A₍on₎, A₍max₎) links to the sink amplitude in §3.2 via α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎.Channel placement. 𝒜₍00₎ is the monopole control. Dipole/tri-lobe components {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} evolve as in §6–§7 (transient + OU decay) and are not driven directly by J₍eff₎.Solar foil neutrality. The optional solar foil enters the same monopole channel as a tiny additive interaction γ (default γ = 0). It does not alter ℛ₍Nx₎.2.4.5 Calibration, bounds, and edge casesCalibration of j₍0₎ and J₍c₎. j₍0₎ is set in “dry-run” windows by equating a fully-passing single-member (m ≈ 1) to a unit drive; J₍c₎ is then chosen (and frozen) to yield the preregistered onset A₍on₎ through ℛ₍Nx₎. Both values, the mapping ℛ₍Nx₎, and hashes are recorded in the ignition ledger.Clipping and plausibility. We clip m to [−1, 1] and J₍eff₎ to [0, J₍max₎], with J₍max₎ defined by device safe-operations. Negative m (anti-alignment) lowers J₍eff₎ and cannot trigger ignition.Dropouts. If S₍Γ₎ drops below S₍min₎ inside Γ, recompute m on the surviving passers and flag the window; the ignition rule uses the flagged values (still eligible if thresholds are met).Auditability. Every J₍eff₎(Γ) is reproducible from the ops card: membership 𝒫₍Γ₎, ⟨σ₍z₎⟩₍k,Γ₎, shrinkage setting, stability index, j₍0₎, and the fixed ℛ₍Nx₎.2.4.6 Summary (contract)Compute m(Γ) from passing members only, with shrinkage and fixed sign convention.Form J₍eff₎(Γ) = N(Γ)·j₍0₎·m(Γ) and apply ignition guards (N ≥ 25, J ≥ J₍c₎, C₍QND₎ ≥ C₍*₎).Post-ignition, map J₍eff₎ to 𝒜₍00₎ via the preregistered ℛ₍Nx₎, leaving {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} to follow their transient/OU laws.
This contract keeps the Nexus layer fully operational and makes the boundary control 𝒜 auditable and falsifiable.2.5 QND capacity: C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎
Purpose. Guard ignition with an information-at-bounded-disturbance check. Over a preregistered window length τ, we require the Nexus to demonstrate that it can read the drive axis (z) non-demolitionally with sufficient predictive power while keeping back-action below a fixed budget. Formally, the window passes iff C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎ (threshold frozen in preregistration).

2.5.1 Two-shot QND micro-trial (per member)
Within each window Γ we interleave ordinary shots with QND micro-trials on a randomized subset of passing members 𝒫₍Γ₎:Trial structure for member k: (t₁, z, y₁) then (t₂, z, y₂) with t₂−t₁ ∈ Δ ∈ [Δ₍min₎, Δ₍max₎] (both preregistered). Axes and inclusion are drawn from a public randomness beacon; seeds are logged.Predictive power (binary mutual information). From the empirical joint over {y₁,y₂} we compute
I₍k,Γ₎ ≡ I(y₁; y₂) ∈ [0, 1] (bits), with Miller–Madow bias correction and permutation-null debiasing inside Γ.Disturbance metrics (bounded back-action).
(i) Local: Δ𝒞₍k,Γ₎ ≡ 𝒞₍k,post₎ − 𝒞₍k,pre₎ across equal-duration subwindows bracketing the trial set;
(ii) Network: ΔW₍k,Γ₎ ≡ W₍N,post₎ − W₍N,pre₎ restricted to cohorts containing k (as in §2.3). Positive values indicate loss. Both are clipped below at 0: x⁺ ≡ max(x, 0).Per-member QND score.
q₍k,Γ₎ ≡ clip₍0→1₎( I₍k,Γ₎ − λ·Δ𝒞₍k,Γ₎⁺ − μ·ΔW₍k,Γ₎⁺ ),
with penalties λ, μ preregistered. Intuition: award predictive bits, penalize any observed demolition.2.5.2 Window capacity and pass ruleAggregate capacity. Over the trialled members 𝒫₍QND,Γ₎ ⊆ 𝒫₍Γ₎,
C₍QND₎(τ; Γ) ≡ (1/|𝒫₍QND,Γ₎|) ∑₍k∈𝒫₍QND,Γ₎₎ q₍k,Γ₎.
We also record coverage f₍QND,Γ₎ ≡ |𝒫₍QND,Γ₎| / S₍Γ₎.Guard (pass/fail). Γ passes the QND guard if C₍QND₎(τ; Γ) ≥ C₍₎ and f₍QND,Γ₎ ≥ f₍min₎. The pair (C₍₎, f₍min₎) is frozen.Ignition coupling. The ignition rule in §2.4/§2.6 requires this guard in addition to N ≥ 25 and J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎. No partial credit: if QND fails, the window cannot ignite.2.5.3 Nulls, audits, and robustnessAsynchronous null bank. We estimate null distributions for I₍k,Γ₎ by (i) lag-scramble (circularly shift timestamps per member by >Δ₍max₎), (ii) axis-resample (resample z vs non-z frequencies per member), (iii) sign-flip (memberwise outcome flips). Per-null p-values and bias corrections are logged.Clock-jitter audit. QND trials are discarded if clock skew tests fail (same audit as §2.3).Adversarial resilience. Beacon-derived scheduling prevents replay; penalties guard against “read-and-reset” demolition masked as predictability.Stationarity slice. Trials are stratified across the window to detect drifts; a slice-wise spread larger than a preregistered bound flags the window.2.5.4 Parameters, units, and defaults (preregistered)Window length τ; trial spacing band [Δ₍min₎, Δ₍max₎]; trial count per member per window.Penalties λ, μ (dimensionless); coverage floor f₍min₎; capacity threshold C₍*₎ (bits).Null replicate counts; permutation seeds; jitter tolerances.
All values and hashes are recorded in the ops card for Γ.2.5.5 Reporting and linkagePer-member outputs: {I₍k,Γ₎, Δ𝒞₍k,Γ₎, ΔW₍k,Γ₎, q₍k,Γ₎}.Window outputs: {C₍QND₎(τ; Γ), f₍QND,Γ₎, pass/fail, null summaries, audits}.Downstream usage: The QND guard is a gate, not a multiplier. When it passes, members remain eligible for m(Γ) (hence J₍eff₎) as in §2.4; when it fails, the window cannot contribute to ignition regardless of J₍eff₎.2.5.6 Rationale (why this is the right guard)Operational and auditable. Defined only from within-window data, with public randomness and logged seeds.Model-agnostic. Makes no device-level assumptions beyond binary outcomes and time stamps; nulls preserve per-member marginals and latencies.Aligned with physics. Rewards non-demolition (predictive reads) and penalizes back-action on coherence and multipartite structure—the correct notion for sustaining a boundary-controlled χ sink without destroying the source register.2.6 Ignition rule: first t with N(t) ≥ 25 and J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎ (plus C₍QND₎ guard)
Purpose. Define a single, preregistered first-hit rule that converts windowed Nexus performance into a unique ignition time t₍ign₎, with no post-hoc tuning. Ignition is an operational event in the Nexus layer; χ-sector responses (§6–§7) are analyzed after t₍ign₎ under causal timing.

2.6.1 Objects and thresholds (frozen)Windows. Non-overlapping challenge windows Γᵢ = [t₍0,ᵢ₎, t₍0,ᵢ₎+τ], with fixed duration τ and timestamp resolution δt₍clk₎.Counts. N(Γ) = |𝒮₍act₎(Γ)|; cardinality threshold N₍c₎ = 25.Drive. J₍eff₎(Γ) = N(Γ)·j₍0₎·m(Γ). Drive threshold J₍c₎ is fixed by calibration (see §2.4.5).QND guard. Capacity C₍QND₎(τ; Γ) with coverage f₍QND,Γ₎; thresholds C₍*₎ and f₍min₎.Audits. Clock-jitter and independence audits must be green (as in §2.3, §2.5).All thresholds {N₍c₎, J₍c₎, C₍*₎, f₍min₎, τ, δt₍clk₎} are preregistered and immutable.

2.6.2 First-hit decision (window level)
A window Γ qualifies for ignition if and only if all hold simultaneously:Cardinality: N(Γ) ≥ N₍c₎.Drive: J₍eff₎(Γ) ≥ J₍c₎.QND capacity: C₍QND₎(τ; Γ) ≥ C₍*₎ and f₍QND,Γ₎ ≥ f₍min₎.Audits: clock-jitter and independence audits pass.Let 𝒬 be the set of indices of qualifying windows ordered in time. The ignition window is the earliest element Γ⋆ ∈ 𝒬. The ignition time is the window midpoint
t₍ign₎ ≡ t₍0,⋆₎ + τ⁽1⁄2⁾.
No partial credit: failure of any guard disqualifies the window.

2.6.3 Within-window tie-breakers and precisionEdge crossing inside Γ. If time-resolved estimates show the drive crossing J₍c₎ at tₓ ∈ Γ while all other guards already hold inside Γ, we refine to t₍ign₎ = round₍δt₍clk₎₎(tₓ). The refinement procedure is preregistered (spline or monotone step); hashes recorded.Simultaneous sites. If multiple sites run independent Γ’s, we compute t₍ign₎ per site and take the earliest t₍ign₎ among those with green audits; all others become confirmation windows.2.6.4 Post-ignition contract (what changes, what cannot)Boundary control. For t < t₍ign₎, 𝒜₍00₎(t) = 0. For t ≥ t₍ign₎, 𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍eff₎(t)) as in §2.4.4 (causal, non-decreasing). Dipole/tri-lobe {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} follow the transient + OU laws (§6).χ-sector expectations. After t₍ign₎ we expect a short ignition transient with parameters (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎), then secular isotropization with finite τ₍A₎, and a local decrease of θ₍G₎(t) consistent with §6–§7.No retune. Thresholds and ℛ₍Nx₎ remain fixed; instrument models can be updated only in future windows under prereg rules, never retroactively across t₍ign₎.2.6.5 Abort, pause, and de-ignition semanticsAbort in-window. If an audit fails inside Γ⋆ (e.g., clock jitter spike), Γ⋆ is void and cannot ignite; the next window is evaluated fresh.Pause between windows. Missing data between Γᵢ and Γᵢ₊₁ do not shift t₍ign₎ once determined; analysis windows must remain disjoint.De-ignition (practical irreversibility). We define a de-ignition flag only if three consecutive windows after t₍ign₎ fail all of: N ≥ N₍c₎, J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎, and C₍QND₎ ≥ C₍*₎. The flag affects ops (e.g., stand-down) but not χ-sector claims already attributed to the original ignition. Absent engineered control, reversal is exponentially suppressed, so statistical rollbacks are not claimed as physics.2.6.6 Ledger, provenance, and reproducibility
For Γ⋆ we record an ignition ledger:Window ID and times {t₍0,⋆₎, τ, t₍ign₎, δt₍clk₎}.Membership 𝒫₍Γ⋆₎, device model hashes, beacon seeds, audit statuses.Scalars {N(Γ⋆), m(Γ⋆), J₍eff₎(Γ⋆)} and QND fields {C₍QND₎(τ; Γ⋆), f₍QND,Γ⋆₎}.Refinement method and hash if t₍ign₎ <→ midpoint was refined.𝒜-mapping ℛ₍Nx₎ and calibration tuple (j₍0₎, J₍c₎, A₍on₎, A₍max₎).This packet is immutable, signed, and referenced by all downstream χ-sector analyses.

2.6.7 What would invalidate an ignition claim
Any one of the following retroactively voids ignition:
(i) Proven audit failure in Γ⋆ (clock or independence).
(ii) Post-hoc discovery that N(Γ⋆) < 25 or J₍eff₎(Γ⋆) < J₍c₎ due to miscalibration or data omission.
(iii) QND capacity re-estimation with corrected nulls yielding C₍QND₎(τ; Γ⋆) < C₍*₎.
(iv) Evidence of back-dating (using data outside Γ⋆ to assert earlier crossing).
Voids are logged with a new signed ledger entry and a pointer to the corrected earliest qualifying window, if any.

2.6.8 Summary (one-line rule)
Ignite at the first window Γ where N ≥ 25, and J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎, and C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎ with audits green; set t₍ign₎ to that window’s refined time; from then on, drive the boundary monopole via 𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍eff₎(t)) and analyze χ-sector signals under causal timing.

2.7 Independence, RNG attestations, ethics
Purpose. Guarantee that Nexus data are free of inter-member classical coordination, that all randomized choices are unpredictable and auditable, and that human subjects protections, privacy, and safety are upheld. Independence and RNG attestations are gates for §2.3–§2.6; ethics governs participation and data handling.

2.7.1 Independence audits (no classical side channels)
Physical isolation (site hygiene).
(i) RF: Faraday enclosure or certified RF-quiet room; continuous spectrum scan f ∈ [10 Hz, 6 GHz].
(ii) Network: air-gapped devices; no shared LAN, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or serial links.
(iii) Optical/acoustic: light baffles; acoustic damping; background mics for PSD veto.
(iv) Power: filtered, isolated supplies; line monitors to veto correlated spikes.
(v) Clocking: no shared low-latency clock lines; only LF timestamps with bounded skew δt₍clk₎.
Statistical independence tests (per window Γ).
From shot streams {s₍k,i₎}:Cross-correlation bound. For each pair (k, ℓ) compute ρ₍kℓ₎(τ) on outcomes y with τ ∈ [−Δ₍max₎, Δ₍max₎]. Require max₍τ₎ |ρ₍kℓ₎(τ)| ≤ ρ₍max₎ after removing cohort structure (same w as §2.3).Conditional independence. Estimate I₍cond₎(y₍k₎; y₍ℓ₎ | a₍k₎, a₍ℓ₎) via k-NN or binning; require I₍cond₎ ≤ I₍max₎ under permutation-calibrated p ≤ α₍ind₎.Granger-style lag test. Regress y₍ℓ₎ on lagged y₍k₎ and local covariates; require added predictive R⁽2⁾ ≤ R₍max₎ across τ ∈ [1, τ₍G₎].Active probing (red-team toggles).
Random, preregistered injects: RF tone bursts, optical flicker, power-line tickles, and dummy notifications near devices. Any detectable imprint in cross-member channels above thresholds voids independence for Γ.
Pass rule. All physical checks green, and all stats bounds satisfied with permutation-null q ≤ α₍ind₎. Failures disqualify Γ from entanglement claims (§2.3) and ignition (§2.6).

2.7.2 RNG attestations (unpredictable, auditable settings)
Entropy sources and derivation.
(i) Public beacon B(t) (verifiable, append-only).
(ii) Local QRNG streams E₍site₎.
Derive per-shot seeds by KDF: s₍k,i₎ = cSHAKE256( B(t₍k,i₎) ∥ E₍site₎ ∥ meta ), producing axis choices a ∈ {x, y, z} and trial schedules.
Commit-reveal and tamper-evidence.
Before Γ: publish H₍Γ₎ ≡ SHA3-256( schedule₍Γ₎ ). After Γ: reveal schedule₍Γ₎, verify H₍Γ₎, and check against logs. Seeds, beacon digests, and KDF parameters are recorded on the ops card.
Anti-precompute discipline.
Settings are derived after t₍k,i₎ − δ with δ ≤ δt₍clk₎, enforced by a verifiable delay step or time-lock in the KDF pipeline. Any early derivation flags the shot.
Quality checks.
Frequency and runs tests on axes per member; cross-member axis-pattern coincidences against beacon-predicted rates; p-values recorded. RNG failures void Γ for §2.3–§2.6.

2.7.3 Ethics, privacy, and governance
Consent and scope.
Participants enroll under written consent describing tasks, randomization, data collected, risks, and withdrawal rights. No deception beyond randomization; debrief available on request.
Data minimization and pseudonymity.
Member identities are mapped to pseudonymous IDs; only {timestamps, axes, outcomes, device QC, environmental vetoes} are stored for analysis. No audio/video beyond environmental veto channels is retained.
Safety and workload.
Session length, rest breaks, and fatigue screens are preregistered. Participants may pause or withdraw at any time without penalty.

3.1 Variables and near-isotropic closure (u, F = c₍χ₎ u n̂)
Fields and frames.
We work in the laboratory frame (LF). The radiant-entropy sector χ is described by:Energy density u(t, x) ≥ 0.Flux (3-vector) F(t, x).Propagation speed c₍χ₎ with 0 < c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 (explicit throughout).Local propagation direction n̂(t, x), a unit 3-vector (‖n̂‖ = 1).All quantities are measurable, locally bounded, and piecewise smooth on space–time, except at preregistered domain boundaries.
Anchors and boundary.
Three fixed supermassive-black-hole anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) define the source field and a small anchor-frame anisotropy. We use a celestial boundary with direction label Ω; its χ intensity is u₍0₎(t, Ω). The sky average ū(t) and the corresponding intensity scale Ī(t) are defined in §3.5, with Ī(t) ≡ c₍χ₎ ū(t)⁄(4π). These feed G₍eff₎ in §4.
Near-isotropic (streaming) closure.
In the regime of interest the χ field is nearly isotropic with a single preferred direction n̂ per point. We impose the standard radiative-transfer closure
F(t, x) = c₍χ₎ u(t, x) n̂(t, x)
with the constraint ‖F‖ ≤ c₍χ₎ u and small-anisotropy corrections that are second order in a dimensionless amplitude ε(t, x):
F = c₍χ₎ u n̂ + O(ε⁽2⁾).
Here ε summarizes dipole and higher multipoles set by the anchors and by local boundary control; operationally ε ≈ max{A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} with A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ defined and estimated in §3.5–§7. The O(ε⁽2⁾) remainder is neglected in all leading-order predictions and reintroduced only for systematic-error budgets.
Interpretation and validity.The closure captures free-streaming χ transport with a well-defined local direction n̂; it is accurate when anisotropy is small (ε ≪ 1) and gradients are gentle on the χ mean-free-path scale.Pre-ignition, n̂ aligns with the anchor superposition; post-ignition, n̂ locally tilts toward the domain wall normal while remaining unit-norm.The closure respects causality: information and fronts propagate at speeds ≤ c₍χ₎ (v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ in §6).Positivity holds: u ≥ 0 and ‖F‖ ≤ c₍χ₎ u everywhere.Domain indicator (used later).
We denote the growing Gravastar domain by 𝒟(t) and its indicator by 1₍𝒟(t)₎(x). Inside 𝒟(t) the effective sink α₍Nx₎(t) is active (§3.2), reducing Ī(t) and thus G₍eff₎(t) via §4.
What is estimated vs. fixed.
Fixed: c₍χ₎ bounds (≤ 1), anchors, and notation.
Estimated from data: Ī(t), small anisotropy amplitudes {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}, and any site-specific n̂ tilts (via regressors in §7). The closure then provides F directly from u and n̂, closing the χ→matter push map used in §4.

3.2 Transport and sinks: ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎ − α·u; α = α₍0₎ + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎
Governing balance (LF).
The χ energy density u(t, x) and flux F(t, x) obey
∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎(t, x) − α(t, x)·u(t, x),
with the near-isotropic closure from §3.1: F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂, ‖n̂‖ = 1. Units: [J₍anc₎] = [u]/time; [α] = 1/time.
Sources (anchors) and boundary view.
Three fixed SMBH anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) determine the incident χ field. We model their effect in two equivalent ways (used interchangeably):Bulk source view: J₍anc₎(t, x) ≥ 0 represents effective volumetric injection from far-field rays.Boundary injection view (preferred operationally): J₍anc₎ is absorbed into the celestial boundary condition (§5.2)
n̂·F − c₍χ₎u = J₍anc₎(t, Ω) − 𝒜(t, Ω),
so J₍anc₎ fixes the pre-ignition boundary intensity u₍0₎(t, Ω). The sky average ū(t) and intensity Ī(t) ≡ c₍χ₎·ū/(4π) appear in G₍eff₎(t) (Eq. 4.3).Sinks (background + Nexus).
Attenuation is a scalar field
α(t, x) = α₍0₎(x) + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎(x),
where α₍0₎ ≥ 0 encodes stationary background loss (scattering/absorption) and α₍Nx₎(t) ≥ 0 is a Nexus-driven sink active only inside the growing domain 𝒟(t). The map t ↦ α₍Nx₎(t) is non-decreasing and Lipschitz after ignition, with support starting at t₍ign₎ (zero before). Calibration links α₍Nx₎(t) monotonically to the boundary monopole control 𝒜₍00₎(t) via a fixed response g: α₍Nx₎(t) = g(𝒜₍00₎(t)), g′ ≥ 0 (see §2.4.4, §5.2).
Integral balance and monotonicity.
Let V be a laboratory control volume with outward normal ν̂ and boundary ∂V. Integrating the transport equation and using F = c₍χ₎u n̂ gives
d/dt ∫₍V₎ u = ∫₍V₎ J₍anc₎ − ∫₍V₎ α·u − ∮₍∂V₎ F·ν̂.
In the boundary-injection view (J₍anc₎ treated at the celestial boundary) the volume source vanishes inside V and the χ inventory decreases whenever α increases. In particular, if J₍anc₎ and the boundary inflow are held fixed while α₍Nx₎(t) is non-decreasing, then the sky-average intensity Ī(t) is non-increasing, hence θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎ is non-increasing (by §4.3). This monotonicity underlies the three-body regime in §9.
Causality and fronts.
With F = c₍χ₎u n̂ and α ≥ 0, the transport is a first-order hyperbolic attenuation flow. Ignition switches on α₍Nx₎ inside 𝒟(t); the domain front Γ₍𝒟₎(t) advances with normal speed v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ (causal envelope). Across Γ₍𝒟₎, u and F satisfy standard Rankine-type continuity consistent with the Robin boundary (§5.2).
Anisotropy and small-ε regime.
The sink α is isotropic to leading order; small anisotropy from anchors and boundary control is encoded in {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} and treated as O(ε). Thus F = c₍χ₎u n̂ + O(ε⁽2⁾) and α·u enters the balance at O(ε⁰), ensuring that attenuation does not tilt n̂ at leading order.
Identification and what is estimated.Fixed/known: anchor geometry (hence J₍anc₎ structure), c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 bounds, α₍0₎ maps from calibration.Estimated from data: Ī(t) trajectories, anisotropy amplitudes {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}, and post-ignition α₍Nx₎(t) via its monotone link to 𝒜₍00₎(t) (with priors from §14).
These feed directly into G₍eff₎(t) and the signal templates in §6–§7.Summary (contract).
Transport is attenuated streaming with anchor-set inflow and a two-term sink: a static background α₍0₎ and a Nexus sink α₍Nx₎(t) confined to 𝒟(t). Post-ignition, α₍Nx₎ rises monotonically, driving Ī(t) and hence G₍eff₎(t) downward within causal fronts—precisely the behavior tested by the transient and OU-decay templates downstream.

3.3 Tri-anchor emissions; superposition; parameter ranges
Anchors and geometry (AF→LF).
Three fixed supermassive-black-hole anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) define a celestial triangle in the anchor frame (AF). Let ŝ₍α₎ be the AF unit vector from Earth toward anchor α ∈ {1,2,3}. The laboratory frame (LF) sees slow diurnal/annual modulation from Earth’s rotation/orbit; we treat ŝ₍α₎ as constant over a window Γ and apply known AF→LF rotations when fitting anisotropy in §7.
Far-field χ emission (per anchor).
Each anchor contributes a nearly radial χ stream. We parameterize the effective χ luminosity by L₍α₎ (units: energy⁄time in the χ sector). In the far field (r₍α₎ ≫ source size) the anchor-α contribution near Earth isenergy density: u₍α₎ ≈ L₍α₎ ⁄ (4π c₍χ₎ r₍α₎⁽2⁾),flux: F₍α₎ ≈ c₍χ₎ u₍α₎ ŝ₍α₎,  ‖F₍α₎‖ = c₍χ₎ u₍α₎.
Here r₍α₎ is the instantaneous line-of-sight distance (constant on Γ). These relations define the anchor view of the boundary intensity u₍0₎(Ω) up to small higher multipoles.Linear superposition (near-isotropic background).
At leading order the χ sector superposes linearly:u ≈ ∑₍α₎ u₍α₎,F ≈ ∑₍α₎ F₍α₎ = c₍χ₎ ∑₍α₎ u₍α₎ ŝ₍α₎.
Define the sky average ū and boundary intensity Ī ≡ c₍χ₎ ū ⁄ (4π). The anchors fix ū up to small anisotropy that we compress into two scalars below.Compressed anisotropy (low-rank expansion).
Write the AF boundary intensity as a low-rank spherical expansion around its mean:
u₍0₎(Ω) = ū · [ 1 + A₍1₎ Y₍1⋆₎(Ω; ŝ₍dip₎) + A₍tri₎ T₍3⋆₎(Ω; ŝ₍tri₎) + O(ε⁽2⁾) ],
where Y₍1⋆₎ is a unit-normalized dipole in direction ŝ₍dip₎ and T₍3⋆₎ is a fixed tri-lobe (compressed ℓ = 3 combination) aligned with the anchor triangle; ε ≈ max{A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. We retain only the dipole amplitude A₍1₎ and the tri-lobe scalar A₍tri₎ as operational anisotropy parameters; higher multipoles are absorbed into O(ε⁽2⁾) and treated as systematics.
Pre-ignition calibration and coupling.
Before ignition, the effective coupling is set by the mean intensity:
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t) ⁄ c₍χ₎,  with  Ī(t) = c₍χ₎ ū(t) ⁄ (4π).
The pre-ignition calibration fixes κ relative to Ī so that G₍eff₎ = G₍N₎ (frozen, §4.3). Post-ignition, attenuation inside 𝒟(t) lowers Ī(t) and thus G₍eff₎(t).
Parameter ranges (preregistered boxes).
We use broad but informative ranges to guide inference and systematics:Propagation speed: c₍χ₎ ∈ (0, 1] (explicit causality bound; estimate as posterior in §7).Coupling scale: κ > 0; constrained by pre-ignition calibration to reproduce G₍N₎ within guardrails (PPN/GW).Anchor weights: w₍α₎ ≡ L₍α₎ ⁄ ∑ L₍β₎ ∈ [0,1], ∑ w₍α₎ = 1 (nuisance describing relative anchor strengths; weak Dirichlet prior).Anisotropy: A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ are small (ε ≪ 1). Preregistration adopts tight, mean-zero priors (e.g., half-normal with scale ≤ 10⁻²) consistent with lab bounds; inference yields τ₍A₎ for their decay (§6–§7).Background loss: α₍0₎ ≥ 0 (calibrated constant), α₍Nx₎(t) ≥ 0 (monotone post-ignition, linked to 𝒜₍00₎).Monopole foil (optional): γ small, mean-zero prior centered at 0 (default γ = 0) acting only in the 𝒜₍00₎ channel.Time dependence and stationarity on windows.
On laboratory windows Γ (minutes→hours), anchor geometry and ū are effectively constant; AF→LF rotation is handled by deterministic regressors (known ephemerides). Any observed variation of Ī(t) or {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} inside Γ beyond deterministic rotation is attributed to sinks (α changes) or measurement noise, not to anchor drift.
What is fixed vs. inferred.Fixed: anchor identities and directions ŝ₍α₎; far-field assumption; closure F = c₍χ₎ u n̂.Inferred: Ī(t), A₍1₎(t), A₍tri₎(t) (with OU decay post-ignition), c₍χ₎ (from lags), and optional γ. Relative weights w₍α₎ enter only through the small anisotropy and are nuisance parameters with weak priors.Contract.
The tri-anchor background is a linear, near-isotropic χ superposition that sets the mean intensity Ī and a small, low-rank anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. Ignition does not alter anchor sourcing; it only introduces additional attenuation α₍Nx₎(t) within 𝒟(t), which we detect as a fall in Ī and OU decay of anisotropy under the causal envelope v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎.

3.4 Anchor-frame anisotropy and lab rotation
Frames and fixed geometry.
The anchor frame (AF) holds the three SMBH directions fixed as ŝ₍1₎, ŝ₍2₎, ŝ₍3₎. From these we define two AF primitives used throughout:Dipole axis ŝ₍dip₎ ≡ norm₍Σ₍α₎ w₍α₎ ŝ₍α₎₎, with weights w₍α₎ = L₍α₎ ⁄ Σ L₍β₎ (weak-nuisance).Tri-lobe orientation given by the anchor triangle: let ê₍1₎ ∥ (ŝ₍2₎ − ŝ₍1₎), ê₍2₎ ∥ (ŝ₍3₎ − ŝ₍1₎), ê₍3₎ ≡ ê₍1₎ × ê₍2₎. The compressed tri-lobe scalar A₍tri₎ is aligned to this triad (handedness fixed once).Rotation to the laboratory frame.
The lab frame (LF) sees AF directions rotate deterministically with Earth’s spin and orbit. We write the time-dependent rotation as
R₍AF→LF₎(t) = R₍site₎(lat, lon) · R₍sid₎(t₍day₎) · R₍orb₎(t₍yr₎),
constructed from known ephemerides (precomputed per site). Any AF unit vector ŝ maps to LF as ŝ₍LF₎(t) = R₍AF→LF₎(t) ŝ. Within a window Γ we either (i) treat R constant (short Γ), or (ii) linearize:
ŝ₍LF₎(t) ≈ ŝ₍LF₎(t₀) + ω⃗₍⊕₎ × ŝ₍LF₎(t₀)·(t − t₀),
where ω⃗₍⊕₎ is Earth’s sidereal angular velocity in LF.
Anisotropy carried by rotation.
In AF the boundary intensity is u₍0₎(Ω) = ū·[1 + A₍1₎ Y₍1⋆₎(Ω; ŝ₍dip₎) + A₍tri₎ T₍3⋆₎(Ω; ê₍1₎, ê₍2₎, ê₍3₎)]. In LF the same low-rank content appears with time-varying orientation:dipole vector D(t) ≡ A₍1₎·ŝ₍dip,LF₎(t) with ŝ₍dip,LF₎(t) = R₍AF→LF₎(t) ŝ₍dip₎,tri-lobe tensor proxy T(t) ≡ A₍tri₎·R₍AF→LF₎(t)·T₀·R₍AF→LF₎⁽⊤⁾(t), where T₀ is the fixed AF tri-lobe pattern built from {ê₍i₎}.Site response and deterministic templates.
Each instrument i has a known angular response kernel K₍i₎(Ω). Its anisotropy channel is the sky projection
a₍i₎(t) ≡ ⟨ u₍0,aniso₎(t,Ω), K₍i₎(Ω) ⟩,
which, after the low-rank truncation, reduces to two deterministic templates per site:
a₍i₎(t) ≈ A₍1₎·T₍dip,i₎(t) + A₍tri₎·T₍tri,i₎(t) + O(ε⁽2⁾).
Here T₍dip,i₎(t) and T₍tri,i₎(t) are precomputed from R₍AF→LF₎(t) and K₍i₎(Ω), orthonormalized on each analysis span. These templates carry the diurnal and weak annual phases implied by rotation and orbit.
Windowed treatment.Short windows (minutes–hours): treat T₍⋅,i₎(t) as affine in time using the linearization above; fit local offsets and slopes.Longer spans: use full ephemeris-driven T₍⋅,i₎(t) with known sidereal frequency and an annual modulation; no free phase is introduced—phases are fixed by (lat, lon, time).Post-ignition evolution (how we fit A’s).
After t₍ign₎ the amplitudes follow the OU law (§6):
A₍1₎(t) = A₍1,0₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)/τ₍A₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎),
A₍tri₎(t) = A₍tri,0₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)/τ₍A₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎).
Inference multiplies the fixed templates T₍⋅,i₎(t) by these decaying envelopes, so the only free pieces are {A₍1,0₎, A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎} (plus noise).
Cross-site phase invariants (sanity checks).
For any two sites i, j the predicted dipole template phases satisfy
φ₍dip,j₎ − φ₍dip,i₎ = Δλ₍ij₎ + small(obl, tilt),
where Δλ₍ij₎ is their longitude difference (sidereal convention). Measured phase offsets that depart significantly from this relation flag either clock issues or unmodeled systematics.
Small-ε bookkeeping.
All rotational modulations scale with ε ≈ max{A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. We keep only O(ε) effects in templates and treat O(ε⁽2⁾) as a systematic floor (documented in the instrument error budget).
Contract.
Anchors set fixed AF directions; LF sees a deterministic rotation that transports the dipole vector and tri-lobe tensor into time-varying templates per site. These templates are precomputed (no free phases), then scaled by decaying amplitudes after ignition. This separation lets us (i) subtract rotation cleanly, (ii) pool sites coherently, and (iii) attribute any residual time structure to sinks and propagation, not to changing anchor geometry.

3.5 Boundary intensity Ī(t) and low-rank anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}
Objects.Boundary intensity (sky average): Ī(t) ≡ c₍χ₎·ū(t)⁄(4π), where ū(t) is the sky average of the celestial-boundary energy density u₍0₎(t, Ω).Low-rank anisotropy: two small, dimensionless amplitudes {A₍1₎(t), A₍tri₎(t)} that summarize, to first order, dipole and compressed tri-lobe content induced by the fixed anchors (§3.3) and carried into the lab by deterministic rotation (§3.4).3.5.1 Boundary expansion (AF form, rotated to LF)
In the anchor frame (AF) we write a low-rank expansion around the mean:
u₍0₎(t, Ω) = ū(t)·[ 1 + A₍1₎(t)·Y₍1⋆₎(Ω; ŝ₍dip₎) + A₍tri₎(t)·T₍3⋆₎(Ω; T₀) ] + O(ε⁽2⁾),
with ε ≈ max{A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. The unit dipole Y₍1⋆₎ points along ŝ₍dip₎; the tri-lobe pattern T₍3⋆₎ is built from the anchor triangle T₀. Rotation to the laboratory frame (LF) is deterministic: the shapes rotate; the amplitudes remain A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ (§3.4).

3.5.2 Instrument forward model (site kernels)
Each instrument i sees the sky through a fixed response kernel K₍i₎(Ω). The projected signal is
s₍i₎(t) ≡ ⟨ u₍0₎(t, Ω), K₍i₎(Ω) ⟩ + η₍i₎(t),
where η₍i₎ is instrument noise. After inserting the low-rank form and carrying the deterministic rotation into templates, we obtain
s₍i₎(t) ≈ g₍0,i₎·Ī(t) + g₍1,i₎(t)·Ī(t)·A₍1₎(t) + g₍tri,i₎(t)·Ī(t)·A₍tri₎(t) + O(ε⁽2⁾),
with site constants g₍0,i₎ ≡ ⟨1, K₍i₎⟩ and time-varying template coefficients
g₍1,i₎(t) ≡ ⟨ Y₍1⋆,LF₎(t, ·), K₍i₎ ⟩,  g₍tri,i₎(t) ≡ ⟨ T₍3⋆,LF₎(t, ·), K₍i₎ ⟩.
The LF templates Y₍1⋆,LF₎ and T₍3⋆,LF₎ are precomputed from ephemerides; no free phases are introduced (§3.4).
Small-ε linearization. Because A’s are small, we separate estimation in two stages (monopole then anisotropy) and treat the product terms as first order.

3.5.3 Estimating Ī(t) (monopole projector)
Idea. Remove anisotropy by projecting onto the monopole subspace of K₍i₎, then combine sites.Per-site monopole estimate. Define a projector Π₍0,i₎ that nulls the dipole and tri-lobe templates over the analysis span. Apply Π₍0,i₎ to the data to obtain
ŝ₍0,i₎(t) ≡ Π₍0,i₎ s₍i₎(t) ≈ g₍0,i₎·Ī(t) + noise.
Calibrate g₍0,i₎ in pre-ignition spans; invert to get Ī₍i₎(t) ≡ ŝ₍0,i₎(t)⁄g₍0,i₎.Cross-site fusion. Form the precision-weighted average
Ī(t) ≡ ( ∑₍i₎ w₍i₎·Ī₍i₎(t) )⁄( ∑₍i₎ w₍i₎ ), with w₍i₎ = 1⁄Var[Ī₍i₎].
Report per-site and pooled credible bands.Shape constraints. Pre-ignition: Ī(t) ≈ constant (calibration to G₍N₎). Post-ignition: impose a non-increasing trend with a soft constraint (isotonic or spline with monotone prior). A short, positive ignition transient is modeled in §6; deviations outside that template are penalized by the prior.3.5.4 Estimating {A₍1₎(t), A₍tri₎(t)} (template regression)
With Ī(t) in hand, regress anisotropy on fixed templates:Design per site. Build a design matrix D₍i₎(t) with columns T₍dip,i₎(t) and T₍tri,i₎(t), the orthonormalized versions of g₍1,i₎(t) and g₍tri,i₎(t).Local linear model. s₍i₎(t) ≈ g₍0,i₎·Ī(t) + Ī(t)·[ A₍1₎(t)·T₍dip,i₎(t) + A₍tri₎(t)·T₍tri,i₎(t) ] + noise.Windowed fit. On each window Γ, treat A’s as constants A₍1,Γ₎, A₍tri,Γ₎ and estimate by generalized least squares using the instrument PSD.Post-ignition envelope. Tie windowed estimates to the OU law (§6): A₍⋅₎(t) = A₍⋅,0₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)⁄τ₍A₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎). Jointly infer {A₍1,0₎, A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎} across sites.Sanity checks. Cross-site phase differences must match deterministic predictions from rotation (§3.4). Large residual phases indicate clock issues or unmodeled systematics.

3.5.5 Linking to G₍eff₎(t) and to §6–§7Effective coupling. G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎ (§4.3). All coupling inferences ride on Ī(t).Ignition transient and decay. The wall channel follows I₍wall₎(t) = Ī(t) + A₍sh₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)⁄τ₍sh₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎) (§6.3). The anisotropy channels carry the OU envelope with time constant τ₍A₎ (§6.4); arrival lags across sites bound c₍χ₎ (§7.1).Solar foil. The optional γ enters only the monopole path; its detection is a cross-correlation between Ī(t) and Sun-locked templates (§7.2). The default is γ = 0.3.5.6 Priors, bounds, and reportingPriors. A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ small, mean-zero (half-normal scale ≤ 10⁻² pre-ignition); τ₍A₎ wide log-uniform; A₍sh₎ ≥ 0; τ₍sh₎ in [1 s, 1 d].Bounds. Ī(t) ≥ 0; monotone post-ignition except for the transient kernel; c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 in propagation analyses.Outputs per window Γ. { Ī(Γ), A₍1,Γ₎, A₍tri,Γ₎ } with uncertainties; template phase residuals; goodness-of-fit; site weights. Post-ignition, also record transient fit {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎} and OU parameters {A₍1,0₎, A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎}.3.5.7 Contract
The sky-average monopole Ī(t) is estimated by template-projected fusion across sites and sets G₍eff₎(t). The anisotropy is fully specified by two small amplitudes on precomputed rotational templates, then follows a single OU decay after ignition. This low-rank, fixed-phase structure keeps the inversion stable, cross-site pooling coherent, and all post-ignition claims traceable to a compact parameter set { Ī, A₍1₎, A₍tri₎, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎ }.

4.1 Momentum deposition: f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)·F
Statement (force density).
In the laboratory frame (LF), matter with mass density ρ(t, x) experiences a push from the χ-sector flux F(t, x) given by the force density
f₍dep₎(t, x) ≡ (κ·ρ(t, x)/c₍χ₎)·F(t, x).
Equivalently, the acceleration field for a freely suspended test element is
a(t, x) = f₍dep₎/ρ = (κ/c₍χ₎)·F(t, x).

4.1.1 Where this comes from (conservation + symmetry)Momentum conservation (χ → matter). The χ flux carries momentum density P₍χ₎ = F/c₍χ₎. Any local attenuation or redirection of F transfers momentum to matter. At leading order in the near-isotropic closure (F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂), a linear, Galilean-respecting map with the equivalence-principle weight ρ is the unique local form:
f₍dep₎ ∝ ρ·(F/c₍χ₎).
We set the proportionality to κ (dimension: area per mass) and carry κ explicitly.Equivalence principle (EP-safe). Because the deposition is proportional to ρ, test bodies of different composition respond with the same acceleration a = (κ/c₍χ₎)F (composition enters only through ρ, which cancels). This is the core EP guardrail.Trace-portal microphysics (bridge). In §12 we realize this coupling by a dilatonic trace portal (χ couples to the stress–energy trace), which reproduces the same low-energy form and keeps EM-sector constants fixed.4.1.2 Units, bounds, and signsUnits. [u] = energy·length⁽−3⁾, [F] = energy·length⁽−2⁾·time⁽−1⁾, [c₍χ₎] = length·time⁽−1⁾. Then [F/c₍χ₎] = momentum·length⁽−2⁾·time⁽−1⁾ (momentum flux), and [f₍dep₎] = force·length⁽−3⁾ (force density) as required.Positivity and direction. For u ≥ 0 we have F = c₍χ₎u n̂, so a ∥ n̂ (push along the local χ propagation direction).Subluminal causality. χ information and fronts respect v ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1; the deposition law is algebraic and therefore causal once F is causal.4.1.3 Energy budget (what χ pays for)Mechanical power density. w₍mech₎ = f₍dep₎·v₍matt₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)·(F·v₍matt₎).χ-sector loss. The χ transport equation (§3.2) gives ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎ − α·u. Inside a control volume with fixed inflow, any increase in α (e.g., α₍Nx₎ after ignition) lowers u and hence F, paying the mechanical work plus dissipation.No free energy. All work done on matter is balanced by a corresponding decrease of χ energy inflow/outflow once boundary conditions are applied (Robin condition in §5.2).4.1.4 Shadowing geometry (how attraction emerges)Near-isotropic background. Pre-ignition, F ≈ c₍χ₎·ū·n̂ with small anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. A single isolated body experiences nearly equal push from all directions ⇒ net a ≈ 0.Mutual shadowing. Two bodies partially occlude each other’s incident χ flux cones. The inward solid angle deficit yields a net push toward the partner. For opaque, small bodies at separation r the occluded solid angle scales as ∝ area/r⁽2⁾, producing a 1/r⁽2⁾ attraction.Pairwise limit. Summing over elements of two extended masses reproduces the Newton form with time-varying coupling; §4.2 formalizes this geometry, and §4.3 identifies G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)/c₍χ₎.4.1.5 Anisotropy handling (kept small)Order counting. Insert F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂ = c₍χ₎·ū·[1 + O(ε)]·n̂ with ε ≈ max{A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. The monopole piece determines the Newtonian attraction; anisotropy enters at O(ε) in the local push and O(ε⁽2⁾) in symmetric pairwise forces (leading antisymmetric pieces cancel).What we fit. Post-ignition, {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} follow an OU decay with time constant τ₍A₎ (§6.4); their lab projections are deterministic templates (§3.4–§3.5) and are included as bounded nuisances in all fits.4.1.6 Invariance and framesNewtonian limit. The deposition law is Galilean in the matter sector (depends on F and ρ, not on absolute v except through w₍mech₎).Frames. All fields are evaluated in LF. Anchor-frame (AF) structure only sets the deterministic time dependence of anisotropy templates (rotations carried in §3.4).Metric sector. GR guardrails remain intact (§8): light propagation and GW sector are unchanged; χ acts as a source in the stress–energy budget, not an extra polarization.4.1.7 Laboratory observables (how f₍dep₎ shows up)Free accelerations. Torsion balances and superconducting gravimeters (SCG) measure differential components of a from shadowing; the signal scales with κ·Ī/c₍χ₎ and the geometric occlusion factor.Temporal structure. After ignition, Ī(t) decreases monotonically (modulo a short transient), so the Newton-equivalent strength drops in time: θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎ ↓.Propagation lags. Changes in F propagate with speed ≤ c₍χ₎; multi-site timing of the onset/decay bounds c₍χ₎ (§7.1).4.1.8 Edge cases and boundsThin/transparent media. If a medium is partially transparent to χ, κ becomes an effective coefficient κ₍eff₎ ≤ κ. Our inference treats κ as a global parameter constrained by pre-ignition calibration to reproduce G₍N₎ (§4.3).Strong gradients. When spatial gradients of u are large on the χ mean-free-path, higher-moment closures could enter. Our analysis confines itself to the near-isotropic regime where F = c₍χ₎u n̂ holds; deviations are tracked as systematics.Causality constraint. Any fit implying c₍χ₎ > 1 or negative u is rejected by priors/guards (§7, §15).4.1.9 Contract (what we use downstream)Force density: f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)·F with F from §3.1.Acceleration: a = (κ/c₍χ₎)·F; the Newtonian 1/r⁽2⁾ law arises from shadowing (§4.2).Coupling identification: G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)/c₍χ₎ (§4.3).
These three lines are the sole ingredients needed to connect χ-transport + boundary intensity to laboratory gravity and to the three-body regime in §9.4.2 Shadowing geometry and 1/r⁽2⁾ attraction
Setup (dilute, near-isotropic).
Consider two compact bodies with masses m₍1₎, m₍2₎, sizes R₍1₎, R₍2₎ ≪ r, separated by distance r along r̂. The χ field is near-isotropic with sky-averaged intensity Ī(t) ≡ c₍χ₎·ū⁄(4π) and small anisotropy ε ≈ max{A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. Closure: F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂.

4.2.1 Occlusion and the missing-flux push
Body 2 occludes a small solid angle in the sky seen by body 1. Let σ₂ be the effective χ occultation cross section of body 2 (defined below). The fraction of sky blocked at body 1 is f₂(r) = σ₂⁄(4π r⁽2⁾). The isotropic part of the χ flux removed from that direction has magnitude c₍χ₎·ū·f₂(r) and points along +r̂. In our deposition law (§4.1), the acceleration of body 1 toward body 2 due to this deficit is
|a₍1←2₎| = (κ/c₍χ₎)·[ c₍χ₎·ū·f₂(r) ] = κ·ū·σ₂⁄(4π r⁽2⁾).
Multiplying by m₍1₎ gives the force
|F₍1←2₎| = m₍1₎·κ·ū·σ₂⁄(4π r⁽2⁾).
By symmetry, body 1 casts the same solid-angle deficit for body 2, yielding |F₍2←1₎| with σ₁. Newton’s third law holds when σ ∝ mass (see below).

4.2.2 Effective cross section and EP safety
Define the χ occultation cross section of a body by
σ ≡ κ₍eff₎·m,  with  κ₍eff₎ ∈ (0, κ],
where κ₍eff₎ captures any partial transparency or porosity to χ (opaque limit κ₍eff₎ = κ; thin media yield κ₍eff₎ < κ). This choice:enforces composition independence (EP-safe): σ ∝ m, not material, so acceleration does not depend on composition;guarantees action–reaction: σ₁ ∝ m₍1₎ and σ₂ ∝ m₍2₎ make the pairwise forces equal and opposite.In the opaque, compact-body limit (our default) set κ₍eff₎ = κ.

4.2.3 Newton law with time-varying coupling
Insert σ₂ = κ·m₍2₎ and use Ī = c₍χ₎·ū⁄(4π):
|F₍1←2₎| = m₍1₎·κ·ū·(κ·m₍2₎)⁄(4π r⁽2⁾) = [ κ⁽2⁾·ū⁄(4π) ]· m₍1₎ m₍2₎⁄r⁽2⁾
= [ κ⁽2⁾·Ī⁄c₍χ₎ ]· m₍1₎ m₍2₎⁄r⁽2⁾ ≡ G₍eff₎(t)· m₍1₎ m₍2₎⁄r⁽2⁾.
Thus the inverse-square law emerges with a time-dependent coupling
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎  (Eq. 4.3),
set by the boundary intensity and χ speed. Pre-ignition calibration fixes κ so that G₍eff₎ = G₍N₎; post-ignition, Ī(t) falls and G₍eff₎(t) ↓ 0 inside 𝒟(t).

4.2.4 Corrections and boundsFinite size / near field. For R₍1,2₎ ≪ r the point-mass result holds. Leading geometry corrections scale as O((R₍1₎⁽2⁾+R₍2₎⁽2⁾)/r⁽2⁾) and enter as a shape factor 1+δ₍geom₎ with |δ₍geom₎| ≲ O((R/r)⁽2⁾).Partial transparency. Replace κ by κ₍eff₎ ≤ κ per body; the force becomes (κ·κ₍eff₎)·ū/(4π) times m₍1₎ m₍2₎/r⁽2⁾. Inference treats deviations as nuisance bounded by pre-ignition calibration (§4.1.8).Anisotropy. Small ε ≈ max{A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} yields vector corrections that cancel at O(ε) in symmetric pair forces; the net magnitude correction is O(ε⁽2⁾) and is included in systematics (§3.5, §6–§7).Multi-body crowding. In dilute configurations, pairwise superposition holds at leading order. Non-additive screening enters at O(∑ σⱼ⁄(4π rⱼ⁽2⁾)) and is kept below analysis floors by design; dense-cluster corrections are tracked as a separate uncertainty class.4.2.5 Contract (what we use)Pair force: F₍12₎(t) = − G₍eff₎(t)· m₍1₎ m₍2₎· r̂⁄r⁽2⁾, with G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎.Opacity model: σ = κ·m in the opaque limit (EP-safe, action–reaction satisfied).Corrections: bounded by {δ₍geom₎, ε⁽2⁾, transparency} and folded into guardrailed systematics.This closes the χ-push → Newton map: once Ī(t) is inferred (§3.5), the entire Newtonian sector follows with a single time-dependent coupling G₍eff₎(t), enabling the three-body regime in §9.

4.3 Effective coupling: G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎; pre-ignition calibration → G₍N₎
Definition.
In the near-isotropic regime with F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂ and sky-average intensity Ī(t) ≡ c₍χ₎·ū(t)⁄(4π), the χ→matter push (§4.1–§4.2) is exactly equivalent to Newtonian gravity with time-dependent coupling
G₍eff₎(t) ≡ κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎.
We also use the normalized strength θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)⁄G₍N₎.

4.3.1 Pre-ignition calibration (fix κ to recover G₍N₎)
Choose preregistered pre-ignition windows {Γ₀} with (i) no ignition criteria met (§2.6), (ii) stationarity tests green (§3.5). From §3.5 obtain a pooled monopole estimate Ī₀ ≡ median₍Γ∈{Γ₀}₎ Ī(Γ) with uncertainty σ₍Ī₀₎. Then define
κ ≡ √( G₍N₎·c₍χ₎⁄Ī₀ ).
Consequences:Recovery of Newton: For t in any Γ₀, G₍eff₎(t) ≈ G₍N₎ by construction, up to calibration error O(σ₍Ī₀₎).Operational identity: With κ fixed, θ₍G₎(t) reduces to a pure intensity ratio,
θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₀.
Thus, all Newton-sector dynamics ride on the single observable Ī(t).Site handling. The per-site monopole gains g₍0,i₎ (§3.5) are calibrated in {Γ₀} and frozen; κ is set once from the pooled Ī₀ (not per site), preventing hidden renormalizations.

4.3.2 Identifiability, priors, and the role of c₍χ₎Identifiable combination. Only κ⁽2⁾·Ī⁄c₍χ₎ matters for G₍eff₎. Our calibration makes κ a derived constant at the chosen c₍χ₎ prior.Propagation speed. c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 is inferred from multi-site lags (§7.1). Because κ ∝ √c₍χ₎, tightening c₍χ₎ posteriors merely rescales κ while leaving θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₀ unchanged. Guardrails (PPN/GW) are unaffected.Priors. Ī₀ > 0 with narrow Gaussian prior centered at the pooled estimate; c₍χ₎ log-uniform on (0,1]; κ then follows deterministically.4.3.3 Post-ignition monotonicity and templates
Ignition raises α₍Nx₎(t) inside 𝒟(t), making Ī(t) non-increasing (aside from the short wall transient). Therefore,
θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₀ is non-increasing for t ≥ t₍ign₎, with a brief additive pulse I₍wall₎(t) modeled in §6.3 and OU-decaying anisotropy in §6.4. This is the lever for the three-body regime (§9): ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞ follows when θ₍G₎(t) decays sufficiently fast.

4.3.4 Uncertainty propagation (what we report)
For small errors, fractional uncertainty obeys
δG₍eff₎⁄G₍eff₎ ≈ 2·(δκ⁄κ) + (δĪ⁄Ī) + (δc₍χ₎⁄c₍χ₎).
With κ fixed from Ī₀, we report:Pre-ignition: δG₍eff₎⁄G₍N₎ ≈ δĪ⁄Ī₀ (dominated by monopole fusion error).Post-ignition: propagate the joint posterior of {Ī(t), c₍χ₎}; κ is treated as fixed at its calibrated value (or updated deterministically if c₍χ₎’s prior is sharpened).Systematics from small anisotropy enter at O(ε⁽2⁾) via the monopole projector (§3.5) and are included as a separate error class.

4.3.5 Laboratory inversion recipe (auditable)Project to monopole: per site i, compute ŝ₍0,i₎(t) = Π₍0,i₎ s₍i₎(t).Invert gains: Ī₍i₎(t) = ŝ₍0,i₎(t)⁄g₍0,i₎; fuse to Ī(t).Set κ once: κ = √(G₍N₎·c₍χ₎⁄Ī₀) from pre-ignition Ī₀.Report θ₍G₎(t): θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₀ with monotone prior after t₍ign₎.Map to dynamics: Use G₍eff₎(t) = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎ in Newtonian/PN analyses (§8–§9).All steps reference ops-card hashes (g₍0,i₎, projector design, window set {Γ₀}).

4.3.6 Foils and guardrailsSolar foil γ. Acts only in the monopole channel of the boundary control; by default γ = 0. If γ ≠ 0, it perturbs Ī(t) with Sun-locked templates (§7.2). We test this via a preregistered Bayes factor and otherwise keep κ unchanged.GR/EP consistency. Because G₍eff₎ is a scalar function of time and the push law is proportional to ρ, composition independence is preserved and PPN/GW constraints remain intact (§8). No EM-sector drift is induced.4.3.7 Contract (takeaway)Definition: G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎; θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₀.Calibration: Fix κ once so pre-ignition G₍eff₎ = G₍N₎.Inference: After ignition, tracking Ī(t) is tracking gravity. Everything downstream—signals, theorem regime, and foils—reduces to estimating Ī(t) cleanly and enforcing causal/monotone structure.4.4 Anisotropy corrections; lab bounds
Small parameter and bookkeeping.
Write the boundary field in AF as
u₍0₎(t,Ω) = ū(t)·[ 1 + A₍1₎(t)·Y₍1⋆₎(Ω; ŝ₍dip₎) + A₍tri₎(t)·T₍3⋆₎(Ω; T₀) ] + O(ε⁽2⁾),
with ε ≡ max{ |A₍1₎|, |A₍tri₎| }. The near-isotropic closure gives F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂ and hence, to first order in ε,
F(t,x) = c₍χ₎·ū(t)·[ 1 + A₍1₎·Ỹ₍1⋆₎ + A₍tri₎·T̃₍3⋆₎ ]·n̂₍0₎(t,x) + O(ε⁽2⁾),
where the tilded shapes are the LF-rotated templates (§3.4), and n̂₍0₎ is the local propagation direction in the ε → 0 limit.
Impact on pair forces (why Newton survives).
For two opaque compact bodies at separation r (dilute limit), the isotropic part of F yields the 1/r⁽2⁾ law with coupling G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)/c₍χ₎ (§4.2–§4.3). The leading anisotropy corrections:Odd-parity cancellation. The dipole piece produces opposite-signed solid-angle deficits on the two bodies, so the O(ε) vector correction cancels in the symmetric pair force; the net magnitude shift enters at O(ε⁽2⁾).Tri-lobe leakage. The compressed ℓ = 3 content also contributes only at O(ε⁽2⁾) to the magnitude in the symmetric limit.Thus the pairwise law remains
F₍12₎(t) = − G₍eff₎(t)·m₍1₎ m₍2₎·r̂⁄r⁽2⁾·[ 1 + δ₍aniso₎(t; geometry) ],
with δ₍aniso₎ = O(ε⁽2⁾) plus bounded finite-size terms (§4.2.4). This is the key guardrail: anisotropy is a nuisance, not a driver, for Newton-equivalent dynamics.
What labs actually see (template channels).
Anisotropy appears as small, phase-locked modulations on instrument readouts via precomputed templates (§3.4–§3.5):
s₍i₎(t) ≈ g₍0,i₎·Ī(t)  +  Ī(t)·[ A₍1₎(t)·T₍dip,i₎(t)  +  A₍tri₎(t)·T₍tri,i₎(t) ]  +  noise,
with T₍⋅,i₎(t) fixed by ephemerides (no free phases). The monopole path g₍0,i₎·Ī(t) sets G₍eff₎(t); the anisotropy path is orthogonalized away when estimating Ī.
Laboratory bounds (method, not just numbers).Pre-ignition limit (stationary epochs).
On windows Γ ⊂ pre-ignition, we fit A₍1,Γ₎ and A₍tri,Γ₎ by GLS against {T₍dip,i₎, T₍tri,i₎} using the measured PSD. For each amplitude A we report a two-sided interval and a site-pooled upper bound
|A| ≤ A₍lim,pre₎ at 95% credibility,
where A₍lim,pre₎ is the precision-weighted fusion across sites.Post-ignition decay (OU envelope).
After t₍ign₎ we enforce A₍⋅₎(t) = A₍⋅,0₎·exp(−(t−t₍ign₎)/τ₍A₎)·Θ(t−t₍ign₎) and infer {A₍1,0₎, A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎}. We publish posterior means and 95% bands; non-detection is expressed as bounds on A₍⋅,0₎ and lower bounds on τ₍A₎ given the templates.Newton-sector leakage check.
We propagate the fitted anisotropy into δ₍aniso₎ using the instrument geometry to verify that |δ₍aniso₎| ≪ analysis floors (pairwise magnitude shift O(ε⁽2⁾)). This guarantees reported θ₍G₎(t) is not biased by anisotropy at leading order.Conservative priors and practical targets.Priors. Pre-ignition |A₍1₎|, |A₍tri₎| ∼ half-normal with small scale (e.g., 10⁻²), centered at 0 (§3.3, §3.5).Targets. Analyses are configured so that even |A| ≲ 10⁻³ yields template SNR < 1 per site over a single window, ensuring monopole recovery is robust; pooled multi-site fits can then set tighter post-hoc bounds. (Exact numeric limits are data-driven and reported, not assumed.)Systematics and vetoes (how we keep bounds honest).Orthogonality to tides. Tidal templates (solid Earth, ocean) and environmental regressors (pressure, temperature) are included and orthogonalized against {T₍dip,i₎, T₍tri,i₎}.Clock/phase discipline. The anisotropy templates have fixed phases from site latitude/longitude and time (§3.4). Any significant phase drift relative to prediction flags the window (§3.5 sanity checks).PSD-aware GLS. Fits weight frequencies by the measured instrument PSD to prevent narrow-band lines from mimicking templates.Null banks. Axis permutations and lag-scramble nulls (from §2.3/§2.5) are repurposed to produce empirical p-values for template coefficients under stationarity.Solar foil separation.
The optional solar foil (γ) lives only in the monopole 𝒜₍00₎ channel. Its test is a Sun-locked correlation in Ī(t) (§7.2). Anisotropy coefficients {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} do not carry γ and thus are not confounded with the solar foil.
Reporting (per analysis span).
We publish, for each site and the pooled fit:
{Â₍1₎ ± σ, Â₍tri₎ ± σ} pre-ignition; {A₍1,0₎, A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎} post-ignition; the implied |δ₍aniso₎| bound carried into Newton-sector uncertainties; template phase residuals; and goodness-of-fit metrics. Non-detections are stated as upper limits at fixed credibility.
Contract.
Anisotropy is kept small, phase-locked, and modelled by fixed templates; it affects Newton-equivalent forces only at O(ε⁽2⁾). Our pipeline projects it out of Ī(t) estimation, constrains it directly with PSD-aware template fits, and carries the residual as a bounded systematic into θ₍G₎(t) and all downstream claims.

4.5 One-dial mapping: all controllables via 𝒜(t,Ω)
Definition (single boundary control).
All experimental influence on the χ sector enters through the boundary dial 𝒜(t,Ω) in the Robin condition
n̂·F − c₍χ₎·u = J₍anc₎(t,Ω) − 𝒜(t,Ω).
Pre-ignition: 𝒜 = 0. Post-ignition: 𝒜 is causally driven by the Nexus via J₍eff₎ (one-dial policy).

4.5.1 Low-rank expansion and the one-dial policy
We expand 𝒜(t,Ω) in a fixed, low-rank spherical basis aligned with the anchors:
𝒜(t,Ω) = 𝒜₍00₎(t) + A₍1₎⁽ctrl⁾(t)·Y₍1⋆,LF₎(t,Ω) + A₍tri⁾⁽ctrl⁾(t)·T₍3⋆,LF₎(t,Ω) + O(ε⁽2⁾).
One-dial commitment.Enabled channel: monopole only, 𝒜₍00₎(t).Disabled channels: A₍1₎⁽ctrl⁾ = 0, A₍tri⁾⁽ctrl⁾ = 0 in all claim windows (templates used only for diagnostics, never for control).
This keeps the experiment identifiable and prevents shaping anisotropy to chase noise.4.5.2 Nexus→boundary map (causal, monotone, saturating)
Post-ignition (t ≥ t₍ign₎) the monopole control is a fixed response of the drive:
𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎( J₍eff₎(t) ),
with ℛ₍Nx₎ non-decreasing, Lipschitz, and saturating:
ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍c₎) = A₍on₎,  ℛ₍Nx₎(J) → A₍max₎ as J → ∞,  support ⊆ [t₍ign₎, ∞).
A default soft-step is used (frozen in preregistration). The χ sink uses a fixed monotone link
α₍Nx₎(t) = g( 𝒜₍00₎(t) ),  g′ ≥ 0,
so raising J₍eff₎ cannot increase Ī(t) (monotonicity guard).

4.5.3 Solar foil as a constrained additive in the same dial
The optional solar foil enters only as a tiny additive in the monopole channel:
𝒜₍00₎(t) ← 𝒜₍00₎(t) + γ·S₍⊙₎(t),  with default γ = 0,
where S₍⊙₎(t) is a preregistered Sun-locked template. No anisotropy control is permitted. γ is inferred by a Bayes factor and reported separately; setting γ ≠ 0 is not required by the core model.

4.5.4 Calibration, priors, and invariantsPre-ignition: 𝒜 = 0; κ is calibrated so G₍eff₎ = G₍N₎ (§4.3).Post-ignition priors: ℛ₍Nx₎ parameters {A₍on₎, A₍max₎, J₍s₎} fixed; g(·) fixed; γ centered at 0 with a tight prior.Invariants: Anchors and ephemerides fix all phases; only the amplitude 𝒜₍00₎(t) moves, causally, after t₍ign₎.4.5.5 Guardrails and failure modesCausality: any detected advance of 𝒜₍00₎ before t₍ign₎ voids ignition (§2.6.7).Locality: 𝒜 modifies only the χ boundary; GR light propagation and GW sector remain unchanged (§8).No anisotropy shaping: A₍1₎⁽ctrl⁾ = A₍tri⁾⁽ctrl⁾ = 0 in claims; nonzero control in these channels is allowed only in calibration windows explicitly excluded from inference.Monotone θ₍G₎: because α₍Nx₎ = g(𝒜₍00₎) is monotone and 𝒜₍00₎ has support after t₍ign₎, θ₍G₎(t) ≡ Ī(t)/Ī₀ is non-increasing up to the short wall transient (§6.3).4.5.6 Inference contract (what the fit actually uses)Inputs: time-stamped J₍eff₎(t), t₍ign₎, the fixed map ℛ₍Nx₎, and the monopole estimator Ī(t) from §3.5.Model: Ī(t) follows the wall transient plus a monotone fall driven by α₍Nx₎(t) = g(ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍eff₎(t))).Outputs: posterior on {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎} and an optional γ; θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)/Ī₀ feeds §8–§9.Audit: hashes of ℛ₍Nx₎ and g(·), and a proof that A₍1₎⁽ctrl⁾ = A₍tri⁾⁽ctrl⁾ = 0 in claim windows (ops-card fields).4.5.7 Why a single dial (and not more)
One dial gives: (i) identifiability of θ₍G₎(t) from Ī(t) without confounding, (ii) falsifiability—no room to retune phases or shapes, (iii) clean causality from J₍eff₎ → 𝒜₍00₎ → α₍Nx₎ → Ī → G₍eff₎, and (iv) guardrail safety—PPN/GW untouched, anisotropy a bounded nuisance.
Contract.
All controllables live in one function 𝒜(t,Ω); only its monopole 𝒜₍00₎(t) is used for claims, driven causally and monotonically by J₍eff₎ after t₍ign₎. Everything else—anchors, phases, anisotropy shapes—stays fixed or inferred as nuisance, keeping the χ→Newton mapping auditable and falsifiable.

5.1 Total action (bulk + χ-transport + boundary)
Goal. Pose a well-posed variational problem whose stationarity reproduces (i) attenuated streaming in the bulk (∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = −α·u), (ii) the near-isotropic closure (F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂, ‖n̂‖ = 1), and (iii) a Robin boundary that carries anchors and the single control dial 𝒜(t,Ω). Metric/GR pieces are included for completeness but are not the lever for laboratory signals (those ride on Ī(t) via §4).

5.1.1 Contents and fieldsMetric sector (Einstein frame). g₍μν₎ with standard boundary term.Matter sector. Standard Model + test bodies (stress–energy T₍m₎); no EM-constant drift.χ transport sector. Scalar u(t,x) (energy density), vector F(t,x) (flux), unit vector n̂(t,x) (propagation direction), attenuation α(t,x) = α₍0₎(x) + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎(x).Multipliers. φ(t,x) (scalar), λ(t,x) (vector), μ(t,x) (scalar) enforce balance and closure.5.1.2 Action (decomposed)
We write
S₍tot₎ = S₍EH₎[g] + S₍mat₎[ψ, g] + S₍χ,bulk₎[u, F, n̂; α] + S₍bdy₎[u₍0₎; J₍anc₎, 𝒜].
(a) Metric (well-posed GR sector)Einstein–Hilbert + GHY (+ optional counterterm).
S₍EH₎[g] ≡ (16πG₍N₎)⁽−1⁾ ∫ d⁴x √(−g) R  +  S₍GHY₎[g]  (+ S₍ct₎ as needed).
In this paper’s lab regime we do not vary g₍μν₎ away from the tested GR sector (§8); the term ensures consistency and receipt completeness.(b) MatterS₍mat₎[ψ, g] is the usual SM action (minimally coupled). The χ push enters the matter equations kinematically via f₍dep₎ (Eq. 4.1); no new light charges, no EM-constant drift (§8, §12).(c) χ transport (first-order, constraint form)
Use a Lagrange-multiplier (Clebsch-type) formulation on LF coordinates:Bulk functional
S₍χ,bulk₎ ≡ ∫ dt ∫ d³x  { φ·( ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F + α·u )  +  λ·( F − c₍χ₎·u·n̂ )  +  μ·( n̂·n̂ − 1 ) }.This compactly enforces:
(i) balance (∂₍t₎u + ∇·F + α·u = 0) via φ,
(ii) closure (F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂) via λ,
(iii) unit norm (‖n̂‖ = 1) via μ.
Anchors are handled at the boundary (below), so there is no bulk J₍anc₎ term.
(d) Boundary (anchors + one dial)
Let ∂𝒱 denote the celestial boundary with outward normal ν̂ and direction label Ω. Define u₍0₎(t,Ω) as the boundary intensity. The boundary functional isRobin enforcement
S₍bdy₎ ≡ ∫ dt ∮₍∂𝒱₎ dΩ  Λ(t,Ω)·[ ν̂·F − c₍χ₎·u − J₍anc₎(t,Ω) + 𝒜(t,Ω) ].Here Λ is a boundary multiplier. Stationarity in Λ imposes the Robin condition
ν̂·F − c₍χ₎·u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜,
which is precisely our boundary law (§4.5). All controllables are confined to one dial, the monopole 𝒜₍00₎(t) (policy in §4.5); anisotropy control is disabled in claim windows.

5.1.3 Euler–Lagrange summary (what variation gives)
Vary on compact domains and use one integration by parts in S₍χ,bulk₎:δφ: ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F + α·u = 0  (bulk balance).δF****:** −∇φ + λ = 0  ⇒  λ = ∇φ.δu: ∂₍t₎φ + α·φ − c₍χ₎(λ·n̂) = 0  ⇒  ∂₍t₎φ + α·φ − c₍χ₎(∇φ·n̂) = 0.δn̂: −c₍χ₎·u·λ + 2μ·n̂ = 0  ⇒  n̂ ∥ λ (and ‖n̂‖ = 1 from δμ).δΛ (boundary): ν̂·F − c₍χ₎·u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜  (Robin).Together with the closure (F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂), these reproduce the transport law of §3.2, the near-isotropic closure of §3.1, and the boundary-first control surface used throughout the inference pipeline.

5.1.4 How sinks and the Nexus enter (no extra freedom)Attenuation field. α(t,x) = α₍0₎(x) + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎(x) is non-dynamical here (an external, preregistered profile). Post-ignition, α₍Nx₎(t) is a monotone, causal function of the dial 𝒜₍00₎(t): α₍Nx₎(t) = g(𝒜₍00₎(t)) with g′ ≥ 0 (frozen map; §2.4.4, §3.2, §4.5).Nexus→dial. 𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍eff₎(t)) after t₍ign₎ (causal, saturating; §2.6). Before ignition, 𝒜 = 0. No other control channels are allowed.5.1.5 Energy–momentum bookkeeping and deposition
The χ sector’s momentum density is P₍χ₎ = F⁄c₍χ₎. In a control volume with fixed boundary inflow (J₍anc₎, 𝒜), the bulk balance and closure imply that an increase in α drains χ energy and momentum. We identify the mechanical push on matter as
f₍dep₎ = (κ·ρ⁄c₍χ₎)·F  (Eq. 4.1),
so the χ loss pays for work on matter. This constitutive identification is outside the variational constraints (kept linear, EP-safe) and ties the action to the Newton mapping in §4.2–§4.3.

5.1.6 Well-posedness, gauges, and scopeWell-posedness. The bulk is first-order hyperbolic (attenuated streaming) and the boundary law is Robin; the GHY term renders the metric sector variationally well-posed.Gauges. φ has an additive constant gauge fixed by boundary conditions; Λ is a pure boundary multiplier (no bulk dynamics).Scope. We keep g₍μν₎ in the tested GR sector (§8). Microphysical UV and the dilaton trace-portal live in §12–§13; they do not alter the transport or boundary calculus here.5.1.7 Contract (what downstream sections use)Transport: from δφ, δF, δn̂ we recover ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = −α·u and F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂ with ‖n̂‖ = 1.Boundary: from δΛ we enforce ν̂·F − c₍χ₎·u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜, with one dial 𝒜₍00₎(t) driven by J₍eff₎ after t₍ign₎.Link to gravity: with f₍dep₎ = (κρ⁄c₍χ₎)F, the monopole Ī(t) sets G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎ (§4.3).
This closes the boundary-first calculus needed for §5.2–§5.4 and for the signal templates in §6–§7.5.2 Single-dial boundary control: n̂·F − c₍χ₎u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜(t,Ω)
Boundary law (Robin form).
On the celestial boundary ∂𝒱 with outward normal ν̂ and sky label Ω, the χ sector obeys the single-dial Robin condition
ν̂·F(t,Ω) − c₍χ₎ u(t,Ω) = J₍anc₎(t,Ω) − 𝒜(t,Ω).
Here J₍anc₎ encodes the fixed tri-anchor inflow (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*). All experimental control enters only through 𝒜(t,Ω).

5.2.1 One-dial policy (monopole only)
Expand 𝒜 in the low-rank anchor-aligned basis transported to the laboratory frame (§3.4–§3.5):
𝒜(t,Ω) = 𝒜₍00₎(t) + A₍1₎⁽ctrl⁾(t)·Y₍1⋆,LF₎(t,Ω) + A₍tri⁾⁽ctrl⁾(t)·T₍3⋆,LF₎(t,Ω) + O(ε⁽2⁾).
Commitment. In all claim windows,
A₍1₎⁽ctrl⁾(t) = 0,  A₍tri⁾⁽ctrl⁾(t) = 0.
Only the monopole dial 𝒜₍00₎(t) is allowed to vary. This removes phase freedom, keeps anisotropy a bounded nuisance, and preserves identifiability of the monopole intensity Ī(t).

5.2.2 Nexus → dial (causal, monotone, saturating)
Let J₍eff₎(t) be the Nexus drive (§2.4). The dial follows a fixed response after ignition:Pre-ignition: 𝒜₍00₎(t) = 0.Post-ignition: 𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎( J₍eff₎(t) ), with ℛ₍Nx₎ non-decreasing, Lipschitz, and saturating:
ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍c₎) = A₍on₎,  ℛ₍Nx₎(J) → A₍max₎ as J → ∞,  support ⊆ [t₍ign₎, ∞).A convenient preregistered choice is the soft-step ℛ₍Nx₎(J) = A₍max₎·[1 − exp(−(J − J₍c₎)/J₍s₎)]₍+₎, where [·]₍+₎ ≡ max(·,0).

5.2.3 Dial → sink (attenuation link) and monotonicity
Inside the growing domain 𝒟(t) the Nexus induces an isotropic sink
α(t,x) = α₍0₎(x) + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎(x),  with  α₍Nx₎(t) = g( 𝒜₍00₎(t) ),  g′ ≥ 0.
Because g is monotone and 𝒜₍00₎ has support only for t ≥ t₍ign₎, the sky-mean intensity Ī(t) is non-increasing after ignition (modulo the short wall transient of §6.3). Consequently θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎ = Ī(t)/Ī₀ is non-increasing (§4.3).
Causality. Changes in the dial cannot influence measurements prior to t₍ign₎; domain fronts propagate with v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ (§6.4).

5.2.4 Energy–momentum at the boundary (bookkeeping)
The boundary law equates net outgoing flux (ν̂·F − c₍χ₎u) to anchor inflow minus control. Increasing 𝒜₍00₎ reduces the net χ inflow into the volume, which—via the bulk balance ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = −α·u—funds the mechanical push f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)F on matter (§4.1). No extra energy source is introduced; the accounting is closed.

5.2.5 Optional solar foil (constrained additive)
A Sun-locked foil enters only in the monopole channel as a tiny additive:
𝒜₍00₎(t) ← 𝒜₍00₎(t) + γ·S₍⊙₎(t),  default γ = 0,
with preregistered template S₍⊙₎(t). This does not activate anisotropy control and is tested as a separate, strictly optional nuisance (§7.2).

5.2.6 Identification, audits, and invariantsInvariants. Anchors, ephemerides, and anisotropy templates are fixed; only 𝒜₍00₎(t) changes post-ignition.Audits. The ops card for each window records hashes of ℛ₍Nx₎ and g(·), proof that A₍1₎⁽ctrl⁾ = A₍tri⁾⁽ctrl⁾ = 0, and the ignition ledger linking J₍eff₎ → 𝒜₍00₎. Any pre-ignition 𝒜 leakage voids ignition (§2.6.7).Well-posedness. With ν̂·F − c₍χ₎u constrained by J₍anc₎ − 𝒜 and the bulk closure F = c₍χ₎u n̂, the transport remains first-order hyperbolic and the boundary problem is well-posed (§5.1).5.2.7 Operational inversion (how data feed the dial story)Estimate Ī(t) by monopole projection and cross-site fusion (§3.5).Map Ī(t) to θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)/Ī₀ and thence to G₍eff₎(t) (§4.3).Use the preregistered ℛ₍Nx₎ and g(·) to predict the monotone drop in Ī from the measured J₍eff₎(t); fit only the transient and OU parameters {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎} and c₍χ₎ (§6–§7).Report any residuals beyond the monotone model as systematics or nulls; do not open extra boundary channels.5.2.8 Contract (one-line)
All controllables live in 𝒜(t,Ω); in claims we allow only the monopole 𝒜₍00₎(t), driven causally by J₍eff₎ after t₍ign₎ and monotonically linked to α₍Nx₎. This boundary-first dial makes Ī(t)—hence G₍eff₎(t)—a falsifiable, single-degree-of-freedom trajectory constrained by fixed-anchor templates and laboratory audits.

5.3 Bulk–boundary projector; well-posedness
Aim. Make the χ-transport an explicit boundary-to-bulk map under the near-isotropic closure (F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂, ‖n̂‖ = 1) with the single-dial Robin law (§5.2), and record the conditions that guarantee existence, uniqueness, causality, and monotone dependence on the dial 𝒜₍00₎(t).

5.3.1 State space and transport operator
Let the state be X(t) ≡ u(t, ·) on a smooth laboratory region 𝒱 with celestial boundary ∂𝒱. Define the streaming field v(t, x) ≡ c₍χ₎·n̂(t, x). The bulk balance (§3.2) is
∂₍t₎u + ∇·(u·v) + α(t, x)·u = 0,
with α(t, x) = α₍0₎(x) + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎(x) ≥ 0. We assume n̂ ∈ W⁽1,∞⁾ (Lipschitz), α ∈ L⁽∞⁾ in space–time, and piecewise continuity in t.
Operator form. On L²(𝒱) (or L¹), define
ℒ(t)u := −∇·(u·v(t,·)) − α(t,·)·u,
with domain D(ℒ(t)) consisting of functions with well-defined inflow trace (below). The problem is non-autonomous: ∂₍t₎u = ℒ(t)u with a Robin inflow.

5.3.2 Boundary operator and inflow/outflow split
Let ν̂ be the outward unit normal on ∂𝒱. The Robin law (§5.2) reads
ν̂·F − c₍χ₎·u = J₍anc₎(t, Ω) − 𝒜(t, Ω).
Using F = u·v and v = c₍χ₎·n̂,
ν̂·(u·v) − c₍χ₎·u = u·c₍χ₎(ν̂·n̂ − 1) = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜.
Define the inflow set Γ₍in₎(t) ≡ { (x,Ω) ∈ ∂𝒱 : ν̂·n̂(t, x) < 0 } and outflow Γ₍out₎(t) ≡ {ν̂·n̂ ≥ 0}. On Γ₍in₎ the natural datum is the incoming intensity u₍in₎, and the Robin law sets it uniquely; on Γ₍out₎ the solution is determined by bulk evolution.
Boundary operator. Denote by 𝔅[u] ≡ ν̂·F − c₍χ₎·u. The Robin condition is 𝔅[u] = S(t, Ω), with S ≡ J₍anc₎ − 𝒜. Because ν̂·n̂ ≈ 1 for radially incoming rays on the celestial boundary, 𝔅 is well-conditioned on Γ₍in₎, and S fixes u₍in₎.

5.3.3 Characteristic lifting (bulk–boundary projector Π₍bdy₎)
Let γ(σ; t, x) be the backward characteristic starting at (t, x) and solving
dγ/dσ = −v(σ, γ),  with  γ(t; t, x) = x.
Let t₍b₎ ≤ t be the first time the ray hits ∂𝒱 at the point (t₍b₎, x₍b₎, Ω₍b₎), and let α∘γ(σ) ≡ α(σ, γ(σ)).
With no bulk source, the transport along γ gives the standard attenuated streaming solution
u(t, x) = u₍0₎(t₍b₎, Ω₍b₎) · exp( −∫₍t₍b₎₎⁽t⁾ α∘γ(σ) dσ ),
F(t, x) = v(t, x)·u(t, x),
where u₍0₎ is the boundary intensity. The Robin relation determines u₍0₎ from S(t, Ω) ≡ J₍anc₎ − 𝒜.
Bulk–boundary projector. Define the linear map
Π₍bdy₎ : S(t, Ω) ↦ (u, F, n̂),
as “Robin → boundary intensity u₍0₎ → characteristic lifting”. Compositionally,
Π₍bdy₎ = 𝒯 ∘ ℛ,  with  ℛ: S ↦ u₍0₎,  𝒯: u₍0₎ ↦ (u, F, n̂).
This is the object we use operationally: changing 𝒜 changes S, which changes u₍0₎ and hence the entire bulk field causally along rays.

5.3.4 Existence, uniqueness, stability (energy estimate)
Under the regularity above (Lipschitz n̂, bounded α, measurable Robin datum S ∈ L²(∂𝒱)), the streaming–attenuation problem with inflow boundary is well-posed:Existence/uniqueness. There exists a unique mild solution u ∈ C⁰([0,T]; L²(𝒱)) generated by an evolution family U(t, s) (a non-autonomous contraction semigroup).Energy inequality. For any t ≥ s,
‖u(t)‖²₍L²₎ + 2∫₍s₎⁽t⁾ ⟨ α(τ,·)·u(τ), u(τ) ⟩ dτ
≤ ‖u(s)‖²₍L²₎ + C·∫₍s₎⁽t⁾ ‖S(τ)‖²₍L²(∂𝒱)₎ dτ,
with a geometry-dependent C. The α ≥ 0 term makes ℒ(t) dissipative; hence uniqueness and continuous dependence on data.Non-expansiveness. If S₁, S₂ are two boundary inputs and u₁, u₂ the solutions, then
‖u₁(t) − u₂(t)‖₍L¹₎ ≤ ‖u₁(s) − u₂(s)‖₍L¹₎ + C∫₍s₎⁽t⁾ ‖S₁ − S₂‖₍L¹(∂𝒱)₎ dτ.
This stability justifies treating 𝒜 as a well-behaved control.(Sketch: Lumer–Phillips for the autonomous case; evolution families for time-dependent α and v; inflow Robin handled by boundary trace theory for transport equations.)

5.3.5 Time-dependent α, ignition, causality, frontsIgnition as time-varying attenuation. Post-ignition α₍Nx₎(t) is Lipschitz, non-decreasing, and supported on t ≥ t₍ign₎. Standard theorems for non-autonomous linear transport with bounded coefficients yield a unique evolution family U(t, s).Causality & finite speed. Along characteristics, information travels at speed ‖v‖ ≡ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1. Therefore, u(t, x) depends only on boundary data evaluated at the retarded times t₍b₎ = t − ℓ/c₍χ₎ (ℓ = path length) and on the integral of α along γ. Domain walls (discontinuities in α supported on 𝒟(t)) propagate with normal speed v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎.Window-wise stationarity. On analysis windows Γ, v and α may be treated as piecewise constant (calibrated), so Π₍bdy₎ acts as a fixed linear lift per window, simplifying inference (§3.5, §6–§7).5.3.6 Monotone dependence on the dial (isotonicity)
Let S ≡ J₍anc₎ − 𝒜 and suppose 𝒜₁(t, Ω) ≥ 𝒜₂(t, Ω) pointwise (same J₍anc₎). Then S₁ ≤ S₂, hence u₍0,1₎ ≤ u₍0,2₎, and by the characteristic formula
u₁(t, x) ≤ u₂(t, x) for all (t, x).
Therefore the sky mean Ī₁(t) ≤ Ī₂(t), and
θ₍G₎₍1₎(t) = Ī₍1₎(t)/Ī₀ ≤ Ī₍2₎(t)/Ī₀ = θ₍G₎₍2₎(t).
Because 𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍eff₎(t)) is non-decreasing after t₍ign₎ and α₍Nx₎ = g(𝒜₍00₎) with g′ ≥ 0, the induced θ₍G₎(t) is non-increasing up to the short, explicitly modeled transient (§6.3). This is the mathematical underpinning of the “one-dial monotonicity” guardrail.

5.3.7 Contract (what downstream sections use)Projector. Π₍bdy₎ is the composition Robin → boundary intensity → characteristic lift, mapping S(t, Ω) = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜(t, Ω) to (u, F, n̂).Well-posedness. With Lipschitz n̂, bounded α, and measurable S, the problem admits a unique, causal, dissipative solution; fronts move no faster than c₍χ₎.Monotonicity. Increasing the dial 𝒜₍00₎(t) can only decrease u and Ī(t) (hence G₍eff₎(t)), formalizing the one-dial policy.These facts justify treating 𝒜₍00₎(t) as a single, auditable control that drives θ₍G₎(t) in §6–§7 and anchors the three-body regime in §9.

5.4 Consistency with GR sector (leading order)
Claim. In the weak-field, slow-motion regime and under the near-isotropic χ closure, the boundary-first dynamics reproduces the tested GR sector at leading order: standard metric potentials, PPN γ ≈ β ≈ 1, GW speed = 1, and no composition-dependent forces or EM-constant drift. The only Newtonian change is a scalar, time-only renormalization of strength via θ₍G₎(t) ≡ Ī(t)⁄Ī₀.

5.4.1 Metric, potentials, and the adiabatic limitEinstein frame. We keep the metric governed by the standard Einstein–Hilbert action (S₍EH₎ in §5.1) with sources T₍m₎ + T₍χ₎.Newtonian limit. For slowly moving bodies and weak fields, the 0–0 Einstein equation reduces to a Poisson law for the potential Φ with an adiabatic effective coupling:
∇²Φ(t, x) = 4π G₍eff₎(t)·ρ(t, x),  where  G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎.
Time variation is slow on orbital timescales (enforced in §3.5/§6), so standard PN bookkeeping applies window-wise.No slip at leading order. In the tested regime, Ψ = Φ up to O(ε⁽2⁾) and tiny χ-pressure terms (below), giving PPN η ≡ Φ⁄Ψ ≈ 1.5.4.2 What χ contributes to the metric (and why it’s harmless)Stress accounting. Near isotropy, a minimal effective stress for χ is
T₍χ₎⁽00⁾ ≈ u,  T₍χ₎⁽0i⁾ ≈ F₍i₎⁄c₍χ₎,  T₍χ₎⁽ij⁾ ≈ p₍χ₎ δ₍ij₎ with p₍χ₎ ≲ u⁄3.
In the lab: u is set by the celestial boundary and is tiny compared with local ρ; anisotropy enters at O(ε). Hence metric corrections from T₍χ₎ are negligible at current bounds and counted as O(ε⁽2⁾) systematics in §4.4.Bianchi identity (exchange). Total conservation holds with an exchange 4-vector Q⁽ν⁾ between χ and matter:
∇₍μ₎(T₍m₎⁽μν⁾ + T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾) = 0,  with  Q⁽i⁾ ≡ f₍dep₎⁽i⁾,  Q⁽0⁾ fixed by the χ energy balance (§3.2).
This realizes the push f₍dep₎ = (κρ⁄c₍χ₎)F without violating GR bookkeeping.5.4.3 PPN and EP guardrailsPPN parameters. Because θ₍G₎(t) multiplies the entire Newtonian source and χ does not introduce new long-range fields in the metric sector, the standard PN expansion yields γ ≈ β ≈ 1 in the tested regime. Preferred-frame and non-conservative PPN terms remain null at leading order.Equivalence principle. The push law is f₍dep₎ ∝ ρ (Eq. 4.1), so test bodies share the same acceleration a = (κ⁄c₍χ₎)F independent of composition. EP is preserved up to the bounded O(ε⁽2⁾) anisotropy residuals already carried as nuisances (§4.4).EM sector. The bridge in §12 uses a trace-portal semantics that does not renormalize EM propagation constants; no α₍EM₎ drift is induced.5.4.4 GW sector (unchanged propagation)Kinematics. Linearized GR on the lab background yields transverse-traceless GWs with speed c₍gw₎ = 1 and standard polarizations.Decoupling. χ enters only as a mild, near-isotropic stress; there is no extra propagating spin-0/1 mode in the metric equations at leading order, and no modification to GW dispersion. This matches the guardrail stated in §8.5.4.5 Orders kept and orders droppedKept: O(v⁽2⁾), O(ε⁰) in forces; slow, window-wise variation in θ₍G₎(t).Dropped: O(ε), O(ε⁽2⁾) into symmetric pair forces (net O(ε⁽2⁾)); finite-size geometry O((R⁄r)⁽2⁾); rapid θ₍G₎ oscillations (ruled out by §6 templates). All are tracked as systematics in §15.5.4.6 Contract (what downstream can rely on)Pre-ignition: θ₍G₎ ≈ 1 ⇒ standard GR phenomenology.Post-ignition: replace G₍N₎ by G₍eff₎(t) = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎ in Newtonian/PN dynamics while keeping γ ≈ β ≈ 1 and c₍gw₎ = 1.Accounting: χ–matter exchange realizes f₍dep₎ without violating conservation; EM constants are fixed.With these guardrails, §6–§9 can treat θ₍G₎(t) as the only gravitational dial affecting motion, while the GR sector remains within tested bounds at leading order.

6.1 Fold response; computing J₍c₎; fixing N₍c₎ = 25
Aim. Specify the onset of Nexus control at the boundary as a fold-like (saddle-node–style) turn-on in a reduced, auditable model; convert that onset into a numerical drive threshold J₍c₎; and tie J₍c₎ to the cardinality N₍c₎ via the calibrated per-member drive.

6.1.1 Reduced static map and “fold-like” onset
We compress the boundary mechanics to a single scalar dial amplitude A(t) ≡ 𝒜₍00₎(t). On analysis windows (quasi-static) we use:Dial law (Nexus → boundary): A = ℛ₍Nx₎(J), with ℛ₍Nx₎ non-decreasing, saturating, and kinked at onset. A convenient preregistered form is the soft-step
ℛ₍Nx₎(J) = A₍max₎·[ 1 − exp( −(J − J₍c₎)/J₍s₎ ) ]₍+₎,
where [x]₍+₎ ≡ max(x, 0). This is a single-valued proxy for a fold: as J crosses J₍c₎ the effective slope jumps from 0 to A₍max₎/J₍s₎.Boundary attenuation (dial → sink): α₍Nx₎ = g(A), with g′ ≥ 0 fixed. For small A,
g(A) ≈ g₍1₎·A + O(A⁽2⁾).Sky-mean response (sink → intensity): the boundary-to-bulk projector (§5.3) gives a monotone decrease of Ī with α. Linearizing the static mean balance on a window,
Ī(A) ≈ Ī₍0₎ − s·A + q·A⁽2⁾ + O(A⁽3⁾),
with s ≡ (dĪ/dA)₍0₎ = (dĪ/dα)₍0₎·g₍1₎ > 0 and weak convexity q ≥ 0.Composition yields an S-shaped static family Ī(J) when plotted against a steep ℛ₍Nx₎, mimicking a fold at J ≈ J₍c₎. We deliberately choose parameters so the operating branch is single-valued and hysteresis-free, retaining “fold-like onset” semantics without bistability (for identifiability and auditability).

6.1.2 Operational onset and the numerical J₍c₎
We define a detectable onset A₍on₎ by requiring a monotone intensity drop that clears a preregistered SNR and QND guard on a single window:Detectability condition. s·A₍on₎ ≥ z·σ₍Ī₎, with z (e.g., 5) fixed and σ₍Ī₎ the pooled monopole noise on a window (§3.5).Guard coupling. The same window must satisfy the QND capacity C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎ (§2.5).Given A₍on₎, invert the dial to get the numerical drive threshold
J₍c₎ ≡ ℛ₍Nx₎⁻¹(A₍on₎).
For the soft-step above, this is explicit:
J₍c₎ = J₍c₎⁽param⁾ + J₍s₎·ln[ A₍max₎/(A₍max₎ − A₍on₎) ].
(Here J₍c₎⁽param⁾ is the step location parameter frozen at preregistration; the log term is the detectability uplift determined by {s, σ₍Ī₎, z}.)
Auditables. We publish {A₍on₎, s, σ₍Ī₎, z} and the exact inverse used, so J₍c₎ is fully reproducible.

6.1.3 From J₍c₎ to N₍c₎ via calibrated per-member drive
The Nexus drive on a window is
J₍eff₎ = N·j₍0₎·m,
with N the active cardinality, j₍0₎ the per-member drive scale (device-level calibration), and m the order parameter from §2.4 (bounded by the superposition/entanglement/QND guards).
To ensure J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎ under worst-case admissible conditions, we use preregistered conservative bounds:Per-member floor: j₍0,lo₎ ≤ j₍0₎ (from device QC).Order-parameter floor: m ≥ m₍*₎ (from §2.2–§2.3 thresholds and §2.5 QND).Availability margin: a₍min₎ ≤ 1 accounts for allowed dropouts within a passing window.Safety multiplier: σ₍J₎ ≥ 1 covers calibration drift between windows.Then any window with
N ≥ N₍c₎  ≡  ceil{ σ₍J₎·J₍c₎  ⁄  ( j₍0,lo₎·m₍₎·a₍min₎ ) }
meets J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎ by construction. Using the preregistered numbers (reported in the ops card), this evaluation yields N₍c₎ = 25, which we freeze and never retune. All later analyses treat 25 as a fixed cardinality threshold; if future calibration tightens {j₍0,lo₎, m₍₎, a₍min₎}, the integer 25 remains unchanged (falsifiability posture).

6.1.4 What “fold-like” buys us and what we forbidPros. A sharp, single-dial onset that is (i) monotone, (ii) auditable, and (iii) strong enough for detection in one window. It also cleanly seeds the wall transient and OU-decay templates in §6.3–§6.5 without introducing extra phases.No hysteresis claims. Although the soft-step emulates a fold, we do not claim bistability or memory cycles; all claims are made on the single-valued branch for identifiability.No hidden feedback. J₍eff₎ is an operational input; we forbid any model path where changes in Ī feed back into J₍eff₎ within the same window (prevents circular amplification).6.1.5 Contract (inputs→outputs)Inputs (frozen): {ℛ₍Nx₎ parameters, g(·), z, σ₍Ī₎, s, j₍0,lo₎, m₍*₎, a₍min₎, σ₍J₎}.Computed: {A₍on₎, J₍c₎} from detectability; fixed: N₍c₎ = 25 from the conservative inequality above.Downstream: With N ≥ 25 and J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎ (plus C₍QND₎ guard), §2.6 triggers t₍ign₎. The post-ignition trajectories of Ī(t) and anisotropy then follow §6.3–§6.5 and feed θ₍G₎(t) in §7–§9.6.2 Post-ignition cascade: Ī↓; G₍eff₎ → 0 in 𝒟(t); v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎
Summary. When the ignition rule (§2.6) fires, the monopole dial 𝒜₍00₎(t) turns on (ℛ₍Nx₎), the bulk sink α₍Nx₎(t) rises (g∘ℛ₍Nx₎), and the χ field undergoes a causal, monotone depletion. The boundary sky-mean intensity Ī(t) decreases, so θ₍G₎(t) ≡ Ī(t)/Ī₀ decreases, and the local Newton strength G₍eff₎(t) = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎ falls inside the growing domain 𝒟(t). Domain fronts propagate no faster than c₍χ₎.

6.2.1 Three phases (operational template)Ignition transient (wall kick).
Immediately after t₍ign₎, 𝒜₍00₎ crosses A₍on₎ (§6.1). We model a short monopole transient on top of the secular fall:
Ī(t) = Ī₍sec₎(t) + A₍sh₎·exp(−(t − t₍ign₎)/τ₍sh₎)·Θ(t − t₍ign₎),
with A₍sh₎ ≥ 0, τ₍sh₎ in [1 s, 1 d] (preregistered box).Monotone secular fall (one-dial).
For t ≥ t₍ign₎, α₍Nx₎(t) = g(𝒜₍00₎(t)) is non-decreasing and the boundary inflow S(t,Ω) = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜(t,Ω) is non-increasing (monopole only). The bulk–boundary projector (§5.3) then enforces
dĪ/dt ≤ 0  (apart from the wall kick).Asymptotic suppression in 𝒟(t).
As α₍Nx₎ saturates to α₍∞₎ > 0 and 𝒟(t) engulfs the lab world-tube, local χ intensity decays exponentially in proper dwell time inside 𝒟(t), driving G₍eff₎ → 0 locally.6.2.2 Causal fronts and arrival times
Let Γ₍𝒟₎(t) be the moving boundary of 𝒟(t); its normal speed obeys v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ by construction (first-order streaming). For a site at distance ℓ along the relevant characteristic, the first observable change cannot precede
t₍arr₎ ≥ t₍ign₎ + ℓ⁄c₍χ₎.
Across sites i, j with baseline Δℓ, the observable lag
Δt₍ij₎ ≥ Δℓ⁄c₍χ₎
bounds c₍χ₎ from above (§7.1). This same timing also locks the onset of the OU anisotropy decay (§6.4).

6.2.3 Local solution and a sufficient condition for G → 0
Along a backward characteristic γ(σ; t, x) with first boundary hit at t₍b₎ and point Ω₍b₎, the bulk solution (§5.3) gives
u(t, x) = u₍0₎(t₍b₎, Ω₍b₎) · exp( −∫₍t₍b₎₎⁽t⁾ α(σ, γ(σ)) dσ ),
with α = α₍0₎ + α₍Nx₎·1₍𝒟(·)₎. Hence a sufficient condition for local extinction is
Ξ(t, x) ≡ ∫₍t₀₎⁽t⁾ α₍Nx₎(σ)·1₍𝒟(σ)₎(γ(σ)) dσ → ∞  as  t → ∞.
If α₍Nx₎(t) → α₍∞₎ > 0 and the asymptotic dwell fraction
f₍occ₎(x) ≡ liminf₍T→∞₎ T⁽−1⁾ ∫₍0₎⁽T⁾ 1₍𝒟(σ)₎(γ(σ)) dσ  > 0,
then Ξ(t, x) ≳ α₍∞₎ f₍occ₎·t → ∞ and thus u(t,x) → 0 exponentially. Consequently
G₍eff₎(t, x) ∝ ū(t, x) → 0  inside 𝒟(t).
(Intuition: once the ray feeding (t, x) spends a nonzero fraction of its life inside an attenuating region with α₍∞₎ > 0, the integrated loss grows without bound.)

6.2.4 From local extinction to the theorem regime
With θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)/Ī₀ non-increasing and local extinction inside the lab tube, we can ensure the three-body regime (§9) by imposing an integrability tail on θ₍G₎:
∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt = G₍N₎ ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ θ₍G₎(t) dt  < ∞.
Operationally, either of the following suffices (and is testable in fits):Exponential tail: θ₍G₎(t) ≤ C·e⁽−t/τ₍G₎⁾ for t ≫ t₍ign₎.Power tail with margin: θ₍G₎(t) ≤ C·(1 + t/t₍⋆₎)⁽−1−ε₎ with ε > 0.Both are compatible with the one-dial flow (α₍Nx₎ → α₍∞₎ > 0) and with the Robin inflow suppression S(t) → 0.

6.2.5 Energy/momentum bookkeeping (no free lunch)
As 𝒜₍00₎ rises, the net boundary inflow S = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜 falls (§5.2), and α₍Nx₎ adds bulk attenuation. The χ inventory in any control volume obeys
d/dt ∫ u = ∮(inflow − outflow) − ∫ α·u,
so the decrease in Ī(t) pays for (i) the mechanical work f₍dep₎·v₍matt₎ on matter and (ii) χ dissipation. No negative-energy flows, no superluminal fronts.

6.2.6 What instruments see (site-level signatures)Monopole drop. SCG/torsion: a step-like decrease in effective Newton strength θ₍G₎(t) beginning at t₍arr₎ and proceeding monotonically (plus the short wall transient).Anisotropy decay. Template-locked OU decay of {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} starting at the same t₍arr₎ (site-dependent), with a common τ₍A₎ across sites (§6.4, §7.2).Causal lags. Site-to-site onset differences Δt₍ij₎ bound c₍χ₎; joint fits triangulate the front orientation.6.2.7 Minimal parametric form (used in fits)
We use a causal, low-dimensional template for θ₍G₎(t) and anisotropy:Monopole: θ₍G₎(t) = 1 for t < t₍ign₎; for t ≥ t₍ign₎,
θ₍G₎(t) = [ 1 − Δθ · S₍mono₎(t − t₍ign₎; τ₍sh₎) ] · M(t − t₍ign₎; τ₍G₎),
where S₍mono₎ is a normalized short-transient kernel (wall), Δθ ∈ (0,1], and M is a monotone envelope (exponential or integrable power) shared across sites but delayed by t₍arr₎(site).Anisotropy: A₍⋅₎(t) = A₍⋅,0₎·exp(−(t − t₍arr₎)/τ₍A₎)·Θ(t − t₍arr₎).Priors and shared parameters are preregistered; only arrival times differ by site via v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎.

6.2.8 Guardrails and failure modesCausality: any detection of pre-t₍ign₎ drift or superluminal cross-site propagation invalidates an ignition claim (§2.6.7).Monotonicity: aside from the wall kick, fitted θ₍G₎(t) must be non-increasing; sustained rises are treated as systematics or nulls.Anisotropy leakage: residual template power must not bias θ₍G₎(t) (orthogonalization in §3.5; checks in §4.4).Locality: cosmology is neutral (f₍V₎ ≪ 1); only the lab domain is affected (§10).6.2.9 Contract (takeaway)
Ignition triggers a causal, one-dial cascade: 𝒜₍00₎↑ ⇒ α₍Nx₎↑ and S↓ ⇒ Ī↓ ⇒ θ₍G₎↓. Domain fronts move with v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎; within 𝒟(t), the integrated attenuation along rays diverges, driving local G₍eff₎ → 0. Multi-site lags bound c₍χ₎; integrable tails in θ₍G₎ place the system squarely in the three-body suppression regime of §9.

6.3 Ignition transient kernel (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎)
Purpose. Capture the short, causal “wall kick” that rides on top of the secular, monotone fall of the monopole intensity after ignition (§6.2). The kernel must be (i) one-sided in time, (ii) positive (no sign-flips), (iii) site-causal (delayed by t₍arr₎ at each site), and (iv) low-parameter so it cannot mimic long-run drift.

6.3.1 Definitions and two equivalent parameterizations
We model the post-ignition monopole as a secular envelope plus a short transient:Additive (Ī-form, used in §6.2):
Ī(t) = Ī₍sec₎(t) + A₍sh₎·S₍mono₎(t − t₍ign₎; τ₍sh₎)·Θ(t − t₍ign₎).Normalized (θ₍G₎-form, convenient for dynamics):
θ₍G₎(t) = [ 1 − Δθ·S₍mono₎(t − t₍ign₎; τ₍sh₎) ] · M(t − t₍ign₎),where θ₍G₎(t) ≡ Ī(t)/Ī₀, M(·) is the monotone, long-tail envelope (exponential or integrable power; §6.2.7), and S₍mono₎(0; τ) = 1, S₍mono₎(t>0; τ) ↓ 0. The parameters relate by Δθ = A₍sh₎/Ī₀ at leading order (M(0) = 1).
Constraints. A₍sh₎ ≥ 0; τ₍sh₎ ∈ [τ₍min₎, τ₍max₎] with preregistered box [1 s, 1 d]; S₍mono₎ is one-sided (support t ≥ 0) and non-negative.

6.3.2 Kernel choices (preregistered family)
We restrict to a tiny family to preserve falsifiability:One-pole exponential (default):
S₍mono₎(t; τ) = exp(−t/τ)·Θ(t).Finite-slew (rise+decay) if needed by device slew:
S₍mono₎(t; τᵣ, τ𝒹) = [1 − exp(−t/τᵣ)]·exp(−t/τ𝒹)·Θ(t),
with τᵣ ≤ τ𝒹 and both in the same prereg box. Use only if a device-level rise-time is documented in QC.We do not allow oscillatory or sign-changing kernels (prevents overfitting the secular envelope).

6.3.3 Physical provenance (why a short kick exists)
Two first-order effects generically create a brief, positive bump just after t₍ign₎:Boundary-layer relaxation. The bulk–boundary projector (§5.3) must re-equilibrate to the new Robin inflow; if α₍Nx₎ rises abruptly, characteristics feeding the lab carry a short-lived mismatch that decays on a dwell-time scale ⇒ one-pole relaxation.Dial slew. ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍eff₎) has finite slope at onset (§6.1); even with perfect causality, a finite-slew step appears at the boundary and relaxes in the bulk as above.Both mechanisms are first-order, motivating the one-pole (or rise+decay) kernel.

6.3.4 Site causality and instrument response
At site i with arrival time t₍arr,i₎ (distance ℓᵢ along characteristics), the predicted observable transient is
S₍obs,i₎(t) = ( S₍mono₎ * h₍i₎ )( t − t₍arr,i₎ ),
where h₍i₎(t) is the measured instrument impulse response (QC). We do not deconvolve beyond a mild, preregistered Tikhonov regularization; instead we forward-convolve the model. Causality requires S₍obs,i₎(t < t₍arr,i₎) = 0.

6.3.5 Identifiability and priorsPriors. A₍sh₎ ∼ half-normal with small scale (centered at 0); log-uniform prior for τ₍sh₎ over [1 s, 1 d]. If the finite-slew form is used, impose τᵣ ≤ τ𝒹 and log-uniform on each.Separation from the envelope. The envelope M(·) is monotone over hours–days; S₍mono₎ decays in seconds–day max. We predefine disjoint time-bands in the likelihood so that S₍mono₎ is estimated from early post-ignition minutes while M(·) is fit on longer spans.Cross-site coupling. {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎} are shared across sites (physics), while {t₍arr,i₎} and h₍i₎ are site-specific. This delivers a powerful joint constraint and the c₍χ₎ bound via arrival lags (§7.1).6.3.6 Fitting recipe (window-wise)Pre-ignition null. Verify that the same transient template fitted on pre-ignition windows yields A₍sh₎ ≈ 0 within errors (calibrates false-positive rate).Post-ignition early band. For each site, fit s₍i₎(t) to
g₍0,i₎·Ī(t) + Ī(t)·[ A₍1₎·T₍dip,i₎ + A₍tri₎·T₍tri,i₎ ]A₍sh₎·S₍obs,i₎(t; τ₍sh₎, t₍arr,i₎)  +  noise,
using the measured PSD for GLS weighting (§3.5). Ī(t) in this early band may be held at Ī₀ or a short linear trend; anisotropy templates are included but do not confound the one-sided kick.Pooling. Combine sites in a hierarchical model with common {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎} and free {t₍arr,i₎}. Report joint posteriors and goodness-of-fit.6.3.7 Guards, diagnostics, and failure modesCausality guard. Any significant S₍obs,i₎ power before t₍arr,i₎ voids the transient claim at that site.Template orthogonality. Check near-zero inner product between S₍obs,i₎ and the anisotropy templates over the early band; else widen the band or down-weight the overlap.Instrument lines. Exclude narrow spectral lines from the early band (or model them explicitly) to prevent false bumps.Cross-site coherence. The fitted {t₍arr,i₎} must obey the geometric lag inequalities (Δt₍ij₎ ≥ Δℓ⁄c₍χ₎); large violations indicate clock or modeling issues.6.3.8 Reporting
Per analysis: {Â₍sh₎ ± σ,  τ̂₍sh₎ with credible band,  evidence (Bayes factor) for A₍sh₎ > 0}, site-wise {t̂₍arr,i₎} with c₍χ₎ upper bound from lags, residual checks, and pre-ignition null results. If the finite-slew form is used, also report {τ̂ᵣ, τ̂𝒹} and the QC justification.

6.3.9 Contract (what downstream uses)
A one-sided, positive transient kernel S₍mono₎ with amplitude A₍sh₎ and timescale τ₍sh₎ captures the short “wall kick,” is shared across sites (up to causal delays), and is separable from the long, monotone envelope driving θ₍G₎(t). These two parameters enter the global fit in §7 and propagate to the theorem regime in §9 only through their impact on the early-time shape of θ₍G₎(t); the integrable tail condition remains governed by the envelope M(·).

6.4 OU decay of anisotropy (τ₍A₎) and isotropization
Purpose. After ignition, the low-rank anisotropy amplitudes {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} must relax to zero under a common, causal decay. We model their decay with a deterministic envelope (single time constant τ₍A₎) plus a tiny, mean-reverting OU jitter that captures stochastic residuals without mimicking the monopole channel.

6.4.1 Process model (envelope + OU jitter)
For each anisotropy channel k ∈ {1, tri} and at a given site i, let tᵢ ≡ t − t₍arr,i₎ (local post-arrival time; §6.2). We write
A₍k₎(tᵢ) = A₍k,0₎·exp( −tᵢ/τ₍A₎ )·Θ(tᵢ)  +  δA₍k₎(tᵢ),
with δA₍k₎ an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck perturbation:
d(δA₍k₎) = −(1/τ₍A₎)·δA₍k₎·dt + √(2D₍A₎)·dW₍k₎(t),
started at δA₍k₎(0) = 0. The OU jitter shares the same τ₍A₎ (no extra time scale) and has diffusion D₍A₎ so small that its stationary variance D₍A₎·τ₍A₎ stays below the analysis floor set in §4.4.
Expectations. E[A₍k₎(tᵢ)] = A₍k,0₎·exp(−tᵢ/τ₍A₎); Var[A₍k₎(tᵢ)] → D₍A₎·τ₍A₎ as tᵢ → ∞.

6.4.2 Forward model on data (template coupling)
At site i the anisotropy contribution to the measured stream is
a₍i₎(t) = Ī(t)·{ A₍1₎(tᵢ)·T₍dip,i₎(t) + A₍tri₎(tᵢ)·T₍tri,i₎(t) },
where Ī(t) is the pooled monopole (§3.5), and T₍dip,i₎(t), T₍tri,i₎(t) are the precomputed, fixed-phase templates transported by Earth’s rotation (§3.4–§3.5). Only the amplitudes carry dynamics; phases are not free parameters.

6.4.3 Priors and identifiabilityInitial amplitudes: A₍k,0₎ ≥ 0 with tight, mean-zero half-normal priors pre-ignition (scale ≤ 10⁻²); post-ignition they are estimated at tᵢ = 0⁺ per §3.5.Time constant: τ₍A₎ has a broad log-uniform prior over a preregistered range (e.g., [10 s, 180 d]); a common τ₍A₎ for both channels enforces isotropization coherence.OU diffusion: D₍A₎ has a small half-normal prior tied to the instrument floor so that √(D₍A₎·τ₍A₎) ≪ A₍k,0₎; this keeps δA from faking secular behavior.Causality: A₍k₎(tᵢ) = 0 for t < t₍arr,i₎ (enforced by Θ).6.4.4 Isotropization metrics and stopping rules
Define a template-weighted anisotropy norm
A₍rms₎(t) ≡ √( A₍1₎² + κ₍tri₎·A₍tri₎² ),
with κ₍tri₎ fixed by template normalization so that both channels contribute commensurately. We report:Half-life: t₍1/2₎ ≡ τ₍A₎·ln 2.Isotropization time: t₍iso₎ when A₍rms₎(t) drops below the pooled pre-ignition bound A₍lim,pre₎ (§4.4).Asymptotic floor: √(D₍A₎·τ₍A₎), which must lie beneath the analysis floor; otherwise we flag residual systematics.6.4.5 Separation from the monopole channel
Orthogonality of templates ensures that anisotropy estimates cannot bias Ī(t) at O(ε). In practice we:Fit Ī(t) with a monopole projector (§3.5) that nulls {T₍dip,i₎, T₍tri,i₎} on each window.Constrain {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} on the residual using PSD-aware GLS, then impose the common exponential envelope with τ₍A₎.Carry the tiny OU jitter as a nuisance that is marginalized, not fitted deterministically.6.4.6 Cross-site coupling and causality checksShared physics: {A₍k,0₎, τ₍A₎, D₍A₎} are global parameters shared across sites; only t₍arr,i₎ and instrument responses differ (§6.3).Lag coherence: The fitted onsets satisfy Δt₍ij₎ ≥ Δℓ⁄c₍χ₎; violations trigger clock or modeling audits (§6.2).Phase discipline: The recovered anisotropy phases track the deterministic templates; significant phase drift flags environmental contamination (§3.4 sanity checks).6.4.7 Fitting recipe (hierarchical)Windowed GLS: Per site, regress residuals on {T₍dip,i₎, T₍tri,i₎} to get window-level {Â₍1,Γ₎, Â₍tri,Γ₎} with uncertainties.Time-stitch: Align windows by tᵢ and fit a shared exponential envelope to both channels with a common τ₍A₎; include OU jitter in the likelihood (Kalman or exact OU covariance).Pool sites: Build a hierarchical model with common {A₍1,0₎, A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎, D₍A₎} and site-specific {t₍arr,i₎}; propagate PSDs.Outputs: posteriors for {A₍1,0₎, A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎, D₍A₎}, per-site t₍arr,i₎, and derived {t₍1/2₎, t₍iso₎}.

6.4.8 Guardrails and failure modesMonotone envelope: Aside from OU jitter, A₍k₎ must decay; sustained re-growth indicates boundary-control leakage or environmental bias.Template integrity: Significant power off the fixed templates (phase errors) invalidates the isotropization claim for that span.Excess jitter: If D₍A₎·τ₍A₎ exceeds the anisotropy analysis floor, we declare an unresolved systematic and quarantine affected windows.Solar foil separation: The optional γ lives only in the monopole; anisotropy channels remain blind to it (§4.5).6.4.9 Contract (takeaway)
Anisotropy is governed by a single, site-causal decay constant τ₍A₎ with a tiny OU jitter. The amplitudes {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} follow A₍k,0₎·exp(−tᵢ/τ₍A₎) after each site’s arrival, on fixed-phase templates. This delivers a compact, falsifiable isotropization story that (i) preserves monopole identifiability, (ii) enables cross-site pooling, and (iii) feeds cleanly into the θ₍G₎(t) inference and the three-body regime in §9.

7.1 Retarded response; c₍χ₎ lag bound (multi-baseline)
Objective. Use causal delays between sites to (i) demonstrate retarded response of χ-driven changes, and (ii) turn those delays into a speed constraint on propagation in the χ sector. The construction is agnostic to instrument type and works with both the monopole wall S₍mono₎ (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎; §6.3) and the anisotropy onsets (τ₍A₎; §6.4).

7.1.1 Retarded template at each site
For site i at position x⃗₍i₎, the observable channel is modeled as a delayed, convolved template:Monopole kick:  s₍i₎(t) ⊃ A₍sh₎·( S₍mono₎ * h₍i₎ )( t − t₍arr,i₎ ),Anisotropy onsets:  a₍i₎(t) ⊃ Ī(t)·[ A₍1₎(tᵢ)·T₍dip,i₎(t) + A₍tri₎(tᵢ)·T₍tri,i₎(t) ],  with tᵢ ≡ t − t₍arr,i₎,where h₍i₎(t) is the measured impulse response and T₍⋅,i₎(t) are fixed-phase rotational templates (§3.4–§3.5). Causality: for both channels, power must vanish for t < t₍arr,i₎.
Estimating t₍arr,i₎. We obtain {t̂₍arr,i₎} by PSD-aware matched filtering of the wall (preferred, highest SNR), cross-checked by the anisotropy envelope start. Windows, PSDs, and fit priors are preregistered (§6.3–§6.4).

7.1.2 Geometry of a causal front
Model the first-change front as a plane with normal f̂ and speed v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎:
t₍arr,i₎ = t₍ign₎ + ( f̂·x⃗₍i₎ )⁄v₍front₎ + ε₍i₎,  with  ε₍i₎ small jitter.
For a baseline b⃗₍ij₎ ≡ x⃗₍i₎ − x⃗₍j₎, the time difference of arrival (TDOA) is
Δt₍ij₎ ≡ t₍arr,i₎ − t₍arr,j₎ = ( f̂·b⃗₍ij₎ )⁄v₍front₎ + (ε₍i₎ − ε₍j₎).
This is a standard hyperbolic localization problem: unknowns {t₍ign₎, f̂, v₍front₎} are determined by ≥3 non-collinear sites (≥4 for overdetermination and robustness).

7.1.3 Multi-baseline estimator (constrained TDOA fit)
We solve for {t₍ign₎, f̂, v₍front₎} by minimizing a PSD-weighted Huber loss over all pairs:
ℒ = Σ₍i<j₎ w₍ij₎ · ρ₍Huber₎( Δt₍ij₎ − ( f̂·b⃗₍ij₎ )⁄v₍front₎ ),
subject to constraints:‖f̂‖ = 1,0 < v₍front₎ ≤ 1 (natural units; guardrail),common {t₍arr,i₎} definition via t₍ign₎ + (f̂·x⃗₍i₎)/v₍front₎.We report MAP and credible regions from a small MCMC initialized at the Huber solution. Outliers (clock slips, veto triggers) are down-weighted by ρ₍Huber₎.

7.1.4 What the lags bound about c₍χ₎
From kinematics, the front speed satisfies v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎. The fit yields v̂₍front₎ with uncertainty; therefore the lag-implied constraint is an interval
v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.
Equivalently, each pair obeys Δt₍ij₎ = | f̂·b⃗₍ij₎ | ⁄ v₍front₎ ≥ | f̂·b⃗₍ij₎ | ⁄ c₍χ₎, so any observed Δt₍ij₎ implies c₍χ₎ ≥ | f̂·b⃗₍ij₎ | ⁄ Δt₍ij₎ once f̂ is known. The multi-baseline solution provides f̂, making the lower edge sharp. The upper edge 1 is the sector guardrail (c₍χ₎ ≤ 1).
(Note: pairwise bounds without f̂ are weaker because | f̂·b⃗₍ij₎ | ≤ ‖b⃗₍ij₎‖.)

7.1.5 Clocking, vetoes, and robustnessClock discipline. All sites are GPS-disciplined (or better). We publish per-window clock drift estimates and require residual drift ≪ min Δt₍ij₎.Environmental vetoes. Earth tides, seismic transients, mains lines, magnetic/thermal spikes: each has a dedicated regressor; windows with coincident veto triggers are excluded.Instrument convolution. We forward-convolve templates with h₍i₎(t), never deconvolve (prevents acausal leakage).Dual-channel coherence. The {t̂₍arr,i₎} from the wall and from anisotropy onsets must agree within priors; disagreements flag modeling/systematics.Nulls. Pre-ignition runs with the same pipeline must return no coherent TDOA solution.7.1.6 Reporting and cross-checks
We publish:{t̂₍arr,i₎} with errors; the best-fit {f̂, v̂₍front₎} ± credible bands;the lag-implied interval v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1;per-pair residuals Δt₍ij₎ − ( f̂·b⃗₍ij₎ )⁄v̂₍front₎ and χ²/ndf;sensitivity maps versus array geometry (which baselines dominate);robustness to dropping any single site (leave-one-out).Geometry note. Adding a long nearly collinear site can tighten v̂₍front₎ dramatically; two long, non-parallel baselines fix f̂ well, collapsing uncertainty on both speed and direction.

7.1.7 Contract (takeaway)Retarded response: each site’s change is a delayed copy of a common template (monopole wall; anisotropy onset), convolved with its h₍i₎.Speed inference: multi-baseline TDOA on {t̂₍arr,i₎} yields an oriented front {f̂} and a front speed v̂₍front₎, which implies the lag bound v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.Falsifiability: any acausal power (t < t₍arr,i₎) or superluminal fit (v̂₍front₎ > 1) invalidates an ignition claim for that span.These bounds feed the global fit in §7.3 and propagate as priors into the Newtonian and three-body analyses (§8–§9).

7.2 Sun↔Earth γ-foil test (monopole lag scan; Bayes factor)
Purpose. Probe an optional Sun-locked monopole suppression added to the single boundary dial (§5.2):
𝒜₍00₎(t) ← 𝒜₍00₎(t) + γ·S₍⊙₎(t), with default γ = 0.
We test γ with a preregistered lag scan and a Bayes-factor model comparison, while enforcing causal and nuisance-orthogonality guards.

7.2.1 Template and channel (monopole only)Sun template S₍⊙₎(t). A unit-variance, zero-mean time series locked to Sun–Earth ephemerides, constructed from preregistered ingredients (e.g., Sun–Earth distance drift, fixed diurnal/annual geometry) and then low-passed to the analysis band. Phases are ephemeris-fixed; no fit freedom in S₍⊙₎ itself.Monopole path only. The foil never enters anisotropy; it perturbs the sky-mean intensity via the dial:
Ī(t) ≈ Ī₍base₎(t) − s·γ·S₍⊙₎(t − τ₍⊙₎),
where s ≡ (dĪ/d𝒜₍00₎)₍0₎ > 0 is the (frozen) small-signal slope from §6.1, and τ₍⊙₎ is a site-common lag (scan variable) capturing χ propagation plus boundary–bulk dwell.
In normalized form: θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)/Ī₀.7.2.2 Models and priors (pre-registered)
We compare M₀ (null) vs M₁ (foil):M₀ (null): θ₍G₎(t) = θ₍base₎(t; A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, envelope, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎,…).M₁ (foil): θ₍G₎(t) = θ₍base₎(t; …) − (s/Ī₀)·γ·S₍⊙₎(t − τ₍⊙₎).Priors.
γ ≥ 0 with a tight half-normal prior centered at 0 (scale set by pre-ignition noise floor); τ₍⊙₎ ∈ [0, τ₍max₎] with uniform prior (τ₍max₎ preregistered). All base parameters inherit the §6 priors. To avoid a look-elsewhere bonus, τ₍⊙₎ is counted in model dimension and integrated (not profiled).

7.2.3 Lag scan and pooled likelihoodPer-lag evidence. For each τ in a grid over [0, τ₍max₎], compute the marginal likelihood Z₍M₁₎(τ) by integrating over γ and base parameters; likewise Z₍M₀₎.Lag-marginal evidence. Z₍M₁₎ = (1/τ₍max₎)∫₀^{τ₍max₎} Z₍M₁₎(τ) dτ (uniform lag prior).Multi-site pooling. Use the joint likelihood across all sites, with site-specific impulse responses h₍i₎ forward-convolved (as in §6.3) and a common τ₍⊙₎ (foil is a global monopole). No site-dependent phases are allowed beyond h₍i₎.Bayes factor. 𝔅₍10₎ ≡ Z₍M₁₎/Z₍M₀₎, reported as ln 𝔅₍10₎ with calibrated Jeffreys tiers. Pre-ignition spans act as negative controls and must return ln 𝔅₍10₎ ≲ 0.

7.2.4 Orthogonality and confoundsAnisotropy: S₍⊙₎ is orthogonalized against the fixed-phase anisotropy templates {T₍dip,i₎, T₍tri,i₎} on each window, so dipole/tri-lobe cannot fake γ.Environmental regressors: Pressure, temperature, tides, and mains lines enter the design and are orthogonalized against S₍⊙₎ (or jointly regressed) with shrinkage priors.Causality & χ speed: If τ̂₍⊙₎ → 0 yet multi-site residuals imply site-dependent phases beyond h₍i₎, treat as environmental correlation, not χ propagation.7.2.5 Decision and boundsDefault stance: γ = 0 unless strong evidence appears. Require ln 𝔅₍10₎ ≥ 5 (or preregistered threshold) and a stable τ̂₍⊙₎ within [0, τ₍max₎] across leave-one-out site tests.Otherwise: report a 95% upper bound γ ≤ γ₍95₎ from the lag-marginal posterior p(γ | data, M₁).Sanity checks: The same pipeline on pre-ignition windows must yield γ-posteriors centered at 0 and ln 𝔅₍10₎ ≲ 0.7.2.6 Reporting
We publish: ln 𝔅₍10₎, the lag-marginal γ posterior with γ₍95₎, the τ-marginal posterior p(τ₍⊙₎ | data) (if evidence), per-site residuals after removing S₍⊙₎, and robustness to site dropout. We also provide inner products showing S₍⊙₎’s orthogonality to nuisance templates in each window.

7.2.7 Contract (what this test can and cannot do)The γ-foil is a strictly optional Sun-locked perturbation in the monopole dial.A detection must clear both Bayes and causality/orthogonality guards; otherwise the outcome is a bound on γ.Anisotropy channels remain blind to γ; θ₍G₎(t) identifiability and the §6–§9 logic are unchanged.7.3 Tri-lobe templates; cross-site coherence
Purpose. Define the tri-lobe anisotropy template tied to the three fixed anchors, transport it from the anchor frame (AF) to each laboratory site (LF), and establish cross-site coherence tests that (i) validate phase predictions and (ii) prevent anisotropy from leaking into the monopole channel.

7.3.1 AF construction (anchor-locked ℓ = 3 pattern)
Let â₍α₎ be unit directions to the three anchors (α ∈ {1,2,3}) in AF with fixed weights w₍α₎ (preregistered; Σ w₍α₎ = 1). We build a zero-mean, unit-variance tri-lobe kernel on the sphere:Seed lobes. Start from a narrow, axisymmetric kernel K(μ; σ) with μ ≡ Ω·â, width σ (preregistered).Tri-lobe sum. T₍raw₎(Ω) ≡ Σ₍α₎ w₍α₎·K(Ω·â₍α₎; σ).Project to low rank. Remove monopole and dipole leakage by spherical projection:
T₍tri,AF₎(Ω) ≡ Π₍ℓ=3⋆₎[ T₍raw₎(Ω) ],
where Π₍ℓ=3⋆₎ is the projector onto the preregistered real ℓ = 3 subspace aligned with the anchor triad.Normalize. Enforce ⟨T₍tri,AF₎⟩₍Ω₎ = 0 and ⟨T²₍tri,AF₎⟩₍Ω₎ = 1 (sky average).This yields a fixed shape T₍tri,AF₎(Ω; σ, w₍α₎) with no free phases.

7.3.2 AF → LF transport (site template T₍tri,i₎(t))
Let R₍AF→LF₎(t) be the time-dependent rotation determined by ephemerides and Earth orientation (preregistered). At site i with latitude φᵢ, longitude λᵢ, and horizon mask Hᵢ(Ω), define the LF template time series:
T₍tri,i₎(t) ≡ 𝓝ᵢ · ∬ Hᵢ(Ω)·T₍tri,AF₎( R₍AF→LF₎⁻¹(t)·Ω )·Wᵢ(Ω) dΩ,
where Wᵢ(Ω) encodes the instrument’s angular response (QC), and 𝓝ᵢ is a normalization chosen so that, for a constant amplitude A₍tri₎ = 1, the site-level power ⟨T²₍tri,i₎⟩₍1 sidereal day₎ = 1. Consequences:Fixed phase. All time variation in T₍tri,i₎(t) is kinematic (sidereal transport); no fit phases.Orthogonality. By construction Π₍ℓ=0,1₎T₍tri,i₎ = 0 over a sidereal day (monopole/dipole removed), ensuring minimal leakage into θ₍G₎(t).7.3.3 Signal model with shared physics
At site i the anisotropy path in the measured stream is
a₍i₎(t) = Ī(t)·A₍tri₎(tᵢ)·T₍tri,i₎(t)  with  tᵢ ≡ t − t₍arr,i₎,
where Ī(t) is the fused monopole (§3.5), t₍arr,i₎ is the causal arrival (§7.1), and A₍tri₎(tᵢ) follows the shared envelope A₍tri,0₎·exp(−tᵢ/τ₍A₎) plus tiny OU jitter (§6.4). Thus:Shared parameters: {A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎, D₍A₎}.Site specifics: {t₍arr,i₎, Wᵢ, Hᵢ, 𝓝ᵢ, PSDᵢ}.7.3.4 Cross-site coherence tests (phase-locked)
We verify that sites see the same physics on deterministic templates:Whitened cross-correlation. Whiten residuals by PSDᵢ and compute C₍ij₎(τ) between a₍i₎ and a₍j₎. The peak must occur near τ ≈ (f̂·b⃗₍ij₎)/v̂₍front₎ from §7.1, with amplitude consistent with the geometry-predicted overlap ⟨T₍tri,i₎T₍tri,j₎⟩.Cross-spectral coherence. On the sidereal fundamental and its low harmonics, the complex coherency Γ₍ij₎(f) should align with the predicted phase from R₍AF→LF₎. Significant deviations flag clock or environmental issues.Template inner products. Report ⟨T₍tri,i₎, T₍tri,j₎⟩ over common visibility; these determine the expected correlation bounds a priori (no fitting).Leave-one-out robustness. Refit A₍tri,0₎, τ₍A₎ dropping each site; stability of posteriors demonstrates that coherence is not driven by a single instrument.7.3.5 Nuisance orthogonality and vetoesMonopole guard. The design matrix includes the monopole projector; ⟨T₍tri,i₎, 1⟩ = 0 by construction prevents bias in Ī(t).Dipole separation. T₍tri,i₎ is orthogonalized against T₍dip,i₎ per site (numerically checked each window).Sidereal vs solar. We test for leakage from daily environmental cycles (solar day) by projecting out the solar-day Fourier line and verifying the sidereal line(s) remain.Environmental regressors.

If coherency phases deviate persistently from prediction, quarantine affected windows and recheck R₍AF→LF₎ inputs and clocks.Solar leakage. Excess power at the solar day after removing environmental regressors triggers a solar-cycle veto (cannot support χ anisotropy).Template mismatch. Large site-to-site dispersion in ⟨T₍tri,i₎, T₍tri,j₎⟩ beyond geometry predictions indicates horizon/response mis-modeling; recalibrate Wᵢ, Hᵢ or down-weight the site.7.3.8 Contract (takeaway)
The tri-lobe anisotropy is a fixed, anchor-locked ℓ = 3 pattern transported kinematically to each site, yielding phase-locked templates T₍tri,i₎(t). A single shared amplitude A₍tri₎(t) (with τ₍A₎) multiplies these templates across sites; cross-site coherence in time and frequency domains validates the χ anisotropy channel while preserving strict orthogonality to the monopole and dipole paths.

8.1 Newtonian dynamics with G(t); adiabatic drifts
Regime. We treat motion in the lab domain with a time-only strength
G₍eff₎(t) = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎,  θ₍G₎(t) ≡ Ī(t)⁄Ī₀,
varying slowly compared to orbital times. Define the adiabatic smallness
ε₍ad₎ ≡ | d ln θ₍G₎⁄dt | ⁄ n₍0₎  ≪ 1,
where n₍0₎ is the pre-ignition mean motion on the orbit in question. Aside from the short “wall” transient (§6.3), we enforce ε₍ad₎ ≪ 1 on all analysis windows.

8.1.1 Two-body drift map (osculating Kepler elements)
Consider a test mass around total mass M with gravitational parameter μ(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)·M = μ₍0₎·θ₍G₎(t). The force is always central, so the specific angular momentum h ≡ ‖r × v‖ is exactly conserved (no torque), even when μ̇ ≠ 0.
Averaging the Gauss variational equations over an orbit with μ̇ small yields:Eccentricity e: no secular drift at O(ε₍ad₎); the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector’s orbital average of μ̇ terms vanishes, so e ≈ const.Semi-major axis a: determined by h² = μ a (1 − e²) with h, e constant ⇒
a(t) = a₍0₎ ⁄ θ₍G₎(t).Mean motion n ≡ √( μ ⁄ a³ ) and period P ≡ 2π⁄n:
n(t) = n₍0₎·θ₍G₎⁽2⁾(t),   P(t) = P₍0₎ ⁄ θ₍G₎⁽2⁾(t).Circular speed v₍circ₎ at radius r = a(1 − e²) for e = 0:
v₍circ₎(t) = v₍0₎·θ₍G₎(t).Hence, as θ₍G₎(t) decreases post-ignition, bound orbits expand (a ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−1⁾), periods lengthen (P ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−2⁾), and speeds fall linearly with θ₍G₎.
Differential form (useful for fits):
ȧ⁄a = − θ̇₍G₎⁄θ₍G₎,   ṅ⁄n = 2·θ̇₍G₎⁄θ₍G₎,   Ṗ⁄P = − 2·θ̇₍G₎⁄θ₍G₎.
With θ̇₍G₎ ≤ 0, we predict Ṗ ≥ 0 (periods increase).

8.1.2 Ignition step and smooth tail
At t₍ign₎ each osculating orbit sees:a tiny, one-sided step from the wall kernel (§6.3): θ₍G₎ → θ₍G₎·[1 − Δθ·S₍mono₎], producing an instantaneous rescale a → a·(1 + Δθ·S₍mono₎) and n → n·(1 − 2Δθ·S₍mono₎);thereafter, a smooth adiabatic drift driven by the monotone envelope (§6.2.7).We model both in the timing residuals and orbital fits; the step is common (up to site lags), while the tail carries the integrable decay needed by §9.

8.1.3 N-body, virial systems, and cluster drift
For a dilute, virialized N-body system with instantaneous potential U ∝ − G₍eff₎ M²⁄R and dispersion σ, the central force remains pairwise and central, so the specific angular momenta of member orbits are individually conserved to adiabatic order. A quasi-homologous scaling follows:
R(t) ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−1⁾(t),   σ(t) ∝ θ₍G₎(t),   τ₍dyn₎(t) ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−2⁾(t),
which preserves the virial combination 2K + U ≈ 0 (since K ∝ σ² ∝ θ₍G₎⁽2⁾ and U ∝ − G₍eff₎⁄R ∝ − θ₍G₎⁽2⁾). Thus clusters inflate while cooling kinematically. This scaling dovetails with the two-body map and prepares the dispersion-to-free-motion transition in §9.

8.1.4 Energy and escape
Specific energy ε(t) = v²⁄2 − μ(t)/r obeys
dε/dt = − μ̇(t)⁄r  (central, no torque).
With μ̇ ≤ 0, ε increases monotonically toward 0⁻. For any bound orbit with conserved h and (adiabatically) fixed e, the escape condition is approached as θ₍G₎ → 0, at which point a → ∞ and the trajectory becomes free in the center-of-mass frame—exactly the asymptotic regime guaranteed by the three-body suppression theorem (§9).

8.1.5 What we fit (observables and guards)Timing channels. Ṗ/P = − 2·θ̇₍G₎/θ₍G₎, ȧ/a = − θ̇₍G₎/θ₍G₎, and step-like changes at t₍arr₎ from §6.3.Sign test. Post-ignition, Ṗ must be non-negative (opposite in sign to GW damping in compact binaries); we require consistency across systems and windows.Adiabaticity. Windows with ε₍ad₎ ≳ 0.1 are excluded from smooth-drift claims and analyzed only for the transient.Anisotropy leakage. Corrections to forces are O(ε⁽2⁾) (§4.4) and are carried as bounded systematics; they cannot mimic the secular Ṗ sign.8.1.6 Contract (takeaway)
In the adiabatic regime with θ₍G₎(t) set by the boundary monopole, orbits obey a universal scaling:
a ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−1⁾,  n ∝ θ₍G₎⁽2⁾,  P ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−2⁾,  v ∝ θ₍G₎,
with e ≈ const and h exactly conserved. Systems expand and slow as gravity weakens; energies rise toward 0⁻ and, under the integrable tail from §6.2, trajectories asymptote to free motion, matching the theorem framework in §9.

8.2 PPN mapping (γ ≈ 1, β ≈ 1)
Claim. In the weak-field, slow-motion regime and on windows where θ₍G₎(t) varies adiabatically (ε₍ad₎ ≪ 1; §8.1), the metric sector is standard PPN with
γ = 1 + O(ε⁽2⁾ + ε₍ad₎),   β = 1 + O(ε⁽2⁾ + ε₍ad₎),
and all preferred-frame and non-conservative PPN parameters consistent with 0 at leading order. The only operational change is a time-only rescaling of the Newtonian potential by θ₍G₎(t).

8.2.1 Metric ansatz and potentials with a time-only strength
Work in isotropic gauge with c = 1. Define the Newtonian potential built from rest-mass density ρ as
U₍N₎(x) ≡ ∫ ρ(x′) ⁄ |x − x′| d³x′,  and U(t,x) ≡ θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎·U₍N₎(x).
To post-Newtonian order,
g₍00₎ = −1 + 2U − 2β·U⁽2⁾ + O(v⁽3⁾),
g₍0i₎ = O(v⁽3⁾) (no new preferred-frame terms),
g₍ij₎ = (1 + 2γ·U)·δ₍ij₎ + O(v⁽2⁾).
Because U inherits only a scalar, time-only factor θ₍G₎(t), its spatial structure and ordering are unchanged.

8.2.2 Why γ = 1 at leading order (no slip)
In the near-isotropic χ regime, the extra stress is effectively pressurelike: T₍χ₎ has tiny anisotropic pieces O(ε) and no long-range propagating scalar that couples to the metric at this order. The linearized Einstein equations then give, in the lab domain,
∇²Ψ = 4π G₍N₎ θ₍G₎(t) ρ + O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎),
∇²(Φ − Ψ) = O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎).
Hence Φ ≈ Ψ and γ ≡ Φ⁄Ψ = 1 up to bounded nuisances (anisotropy O(ε⁽2⁾); slow time-variation O(ε₍ad₎)).

8.2.3 Why β = 1 at leading order (no nonlinear renormalization)
The nonlinearity that feeds β arises from the U⁽2⁾ term in g₍00₎. Our boundary-first control rescales U → θ₍G₎·U₍N₎ but does not introduce self-interaction corrections or new long-range fields. Consequently the coefficient of U⁽2⁾ remains the GR value, giving β = 1 with only O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎) corrections.

8.2.4 Preferred-frame, momentum-conservation, and other PPN slotsPreferred frame (α₍1₎, α₍2₎, α₍3₎). No frame-dependent long-range field is introduced; χ control is a boundary monopole with fixed phases (no velocity couplings). Thus αᵢ = 0 at leading order.Non-conservative parameters (ζᵢ), ξ. Energy–momentum exchange is locally balanced (§5.4): total ∇·T = 0. No anomalous momentum non-conservation is induced; ζᵢ = ξ = 0 at leading order.Nordtvedt parameter. η₍N₎ ≡ 4β − γ − 3 = 0 at leading order (maps to LLR-style bounds in §15).8.2.5 Light propagation (bending, Shapiro) and GW sectorLight. With γ ≈ 1, standard formulas hold. Any experiment interprets mass via μ(t) = G₍N₎ θ₍G₎(t) M on its time window; the shape of bending and Shapiro signatures is unchanged, only the instantaneous strength rescales adiabatically.GWs. Propagate with speed 1 and standard polarizations (no χ-induced extra modes at this order; §5.4).8.2.6 Size of subleading terms and guardsAnisotropy leakage. Pairwise forces receive only O(ε⁽2⁾) magnitude corrections (§4.4). These map into γ, β shifts below our analysis floors and are carried as systematics.Adiabatic drift. Time derivatives of θ₍G₎(t) enter at O(ε₍ad₎); we enforce ε₍ad₎ ≪ 1 on PPN windows and treat any residual as a bounded bias (reported in §15).Solar foil. The optional γ-foil in §7.2 perturbs only the monopole strength; it does not alter γ, β mapping and is tested separately by a Bayes factor.8.2.7 Contract (what to use downstream)
On any analysis window,
(i) build PPN observables exactly as in GR,
(ii) replace G₍N₎ by G₍eff₎(t) = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎ in the Newtonian source,
(iii) set γ = β = 1 in leading-order formulas and carry O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎) as bounded systematics.
This keeps GR-tested sectors intact while allowing θ₍G₎(t) to drive the dynamical signatures modeled in §8.1 and the theorem regime in §9.

8.3 GW sector: TT-only; speed = 1; χ as source
Claim. Gravitational waves (GWs) propagate exactly as in linearized GR: two transverse–traceless polarizations, speed = 1, no dispersion, no extra scalar/vector modes. The χ sector enters only as a conserved source stress and through slow background renormalization of Newton’s strength θ₍G₎(t); it does not alter GW propagation or polarization content at leading order.

8.3.1 Linearized field equation and gauge
Work on a weak, slowly varying background with metric g₍μν₎ = η₍μν₎ + h₍μν₎, |h| ≪ 1, in Lorenz gauge. The linearized Einstein equation is
□ \bar h₍μν₎ = −16π G₍N₎ [ T₍m₎₍μν₎ + T₍χ₎₍μν₎ ]  +  O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎),
where \bar h is the trace-reversed perturbation. Near isotropy, T₍χ₎ is small (pressurelike) and conserved together with matter via the exchange 4-vector Q⁽ν⁾ (§5.4), so the TT projection of the right-hand side is the usual GR source. No new kinetic terms appear for h₍μν₎.
Consequence. The homogeneous operator is the standard □, hence c₍gw₎ = 1 and waves are dispersionless at leading order.

8.3.2 Polarization content (no extra modes)
The χ closure (F = c₍χ₎ u n̂, ‖n̂‖ = 1) adds no propagating scalar or vector degree of freedom to the metric sector. In TT gauge the radiative solution carries only the + and × polarizations; any χ-induced anisotropy affects the source stress at O(ε) but does not project into additional GW polarizations at O(ε⁰). Preferred-frame and non-conservative PPN slots remain null (§8.2).

8.3.3 Speed and dispersion (guardrails)
Because the GW equation is □ \bar h₍μν₎ = source, there is no mass term, no frequency-dependent index, and thus no dispersion to leading order. Sector consistency demands c₍gw₎ = 1; our χ propagation speed c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 is a separate medium property and does not mix into the GW kinetic term.

8.3.4 Source-level effects vs propagationAstrophysical sources. If a GW source resides entirely outside any χ-attenuating domain, its waveform is identical to GR. If a source sits inside a domain where θ₍G₎(t₍source₎) drifts adiabatically, the chirp-rate prefactor rescales through μ(t) = G₍N₎ θ₍G₎(t) M, but this is a source modeling choice, not a propagation change. Our lab program uses windows where external sources are effectively GR-standard.Lab domain. GWs traversing the lab are metric perturbations; they do not scatter on χ because the metric kinetic term is unchanged. The boundary dial 𝒜₍00₎(t) does not couple to h₍μν₎.8.3.5 Detector response and calibration
Interferometer test masses and clocks respond to the metric tidal field as in GR. Composition independence holds (EP-safe push law f₍dep₎ ∝ ρ acts on Newtonian forces, not on GW geodesic deviation). Any slow drift in θ₍G₎(t) affects local Newtonian calibrations (e.g., pendulum bias) but not the relativistic transfer function of a GW detector; we treat such biases as monitored systematics in the instrument model.

8.3.6 Energy flux and conservation
GW energy flux and backreaction follow standard GR formulas. χ–matter exchange Q⁽ν⁾ accounts for momentum deposition f₍dep₎ in the Newtonian sector without adding attenuation to GWs. There is no χ-induced damping of GWs and no extra radiative channel for h₍μν₎ at leading order.

8.3.7 Anisotropy and solar foil (irrelevance to GWs)
The low-rank anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} lives in the χ boundary intensity and appears only as a tiny nuisance in Newton-like forces (O(ε⁽2⁾) on pair magnitudes; §4.4). It carries no TT power. The optional Sun-locked foil γ modifies only the monopole dial and cannot alter GW propagation or polarization (§7.2).

8.3.8 Contract (what to use in practice)Use standard GR GW templates (TT-only, c₍gw₎ = 1).Treat any χ influence only through slow, source-side θ₍G₎(t) (if modeling such sources) or through independent Newtonian calibration channels in the lab.Do not introduce extra polarizations, dispersion, or birefringence from χ.With these guardrails, the GW sector is unchanged at leading order, fully compatible with §8.2 and the boundary-first χ dynamics that govern θ₍G₎(t) in the Newtonian/PN analyses.

8.4 Allowed parameter space; strong-field caveats
Scope. This section declares the admissible region for χ–transport and Newton/PN fits, and fences off regimes we do not claim (strong-field sources, non-adiabatic swings, cosmological volumes). Parameters appearing downstream are constrained here so PPN/GW guardrails (§8.2–§8.3) remain intact.

8.4.1 Parameterization (fit-facing)Kinematics & boundary. c₍χ₎ ∈ (0, 1]; θ₍G₎(t) ≡ Ī(t)/Ī₀ ∈ (0, 1]; monopole dial 𝒜₍00₎(t) = ℛ₍Nx₎(J₍eff₎(t)) with g-monotone link α₍Nx₎(t) = g(𝒜₍00₎(t)), g′ ≥ 0.Monopole shape. Short wall (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎) on a monotone envelope M(t): exponential (τ₍G₎) or integrable power (p > 1, scale t₍⋆₎).Anisotropy. Low-rank amplitudes {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} with a common decay τ₍A₎ plus tiny OU jitter (§6.4).Solar foil (optional). γ ≥ 0 multiplies Sun-locked template S₍⊙₎ (default γ = 0).Newton mapping. G₍eff₎(t) = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎, f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)F.8.4.2 Priors and admissible boxes (pre-registered)Speed. 0 < c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.Adiabaticity. ε₍ad₎ ≡ |d ln θ₍G₎/dt|⁄n₍0₎ ≪ 1 on PN windows (guard: ε₍ad₎ ≤ 0.1; transient windows exempt).Monopole wall. A₍sh₎ ≥ 0; τ₍sh₎ ∈ [1 s, 1 d].Envelope.

• Power: θ₍G₎(t) ∝ (1 + t/t₍⋆₎)⁽−p₎ with p > 1 (integrability for §9).Anisotropy. |A₍1₎|, |A₍tri₎| ≤ 10⁻² pre-ignition (half-normal priors centered at 0); τ₍A₎ ∈ [10 s, 180 d]; OU floor √(D₍A₎τ₍A₎) below analysis floor of §4.4.Solar foil. Tight half-normal prior on γ at 0; τ₍⊙₎ ∈ [0, τ₍max₎] (lag-scan §7.2).Locality. Volume fraction f₍V₎ of ignited domains obeys f₍V₎ ≪ 1 (cosmology neutrality).8.4.3 External guardrails mapped to inequalitiesPPN. γ = 1 + O(ε⁽2⁾ + ε₍ad₎), β = 1 + O(ε⁽2⁾ + ε₍ad₎) ⇒ bound analysis leakage so that
|δγ|, |δβ| ≲ analysis floor; enforce anisotropy only at O(ε⁽2⁾) in forces (§4.4).Light & clocks. No EM-constant drift; Shapiro/bending shapes unmodified—only θ₍G₎ rescales Newton potential on each window (§8.2.5).GWs. c₍gw₎ = 1; TT-only; no dispersion or extra polarizations (§8.3).Causality. Multi-site lags must satisfy v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 (§7.1).8.4.4 Lab-facing derived constraintsPeriod drift sign. Ṗ/P = −2·θ̇₍G₎/θ₍G₎ ≥ 0 after ignition (apart from wall minutes; §8.1).Monotonicity. θ₍G₎(t) non-increasing post-ignition, aside from the one-sided wall kernel (§6.2–§6.3).Integrable tail. ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ θ₍G₎(t) dt < ∞ (exponential τ₍G₎ or power p > 1) to enable the three-body theorem (§9).Anisotropy separation. Template-locked {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} with common τ₍A₎; orthogonal to monopole estimator (§3.5, §4.4).8.4.5 What is excluded (strong-field caveats)Compact binaries / pulsars inside 𝒟(t). We do not claim to model sources embedded in a χ-attenuating domain where θ₍G₎(t) varies on their dynamical time; such systems may exhibit non-adiabatic chirp-mass drift. Our program avoids these and treats external GW sources as GR-standard (§8.3).Near-horizon regimes. Strong-field lensing, ISCO physics, ringdowns: unchanged by construction (no GW kinetic modification), but source-side mass inferences would differ only if the source sat inside a domain—outside our analysis.Rapid control. Any attempt to modulate 𝒜₍00₎ on timescales comparable to orbital periods voids PPN windows (ε₍ad₎ guard).Large anisotropy. Regimes with ε ≡ max{|A₍1₎|,|A₍tri₎|} ≳ 10⁻² (or where template phases drift) are quarantined; anisotropy must be a bounded nuisance.Cosmological-scale domains. f₍V₎ not ≪ 1 would threaten FRW tests; our claims are local and keep f₍V₎ tiny (§10).8.4.6 Practical “allowed region” summary
Admissible fits inhabit the set:0 < c₍χ₎ ≤ 1,   ε₍ad₎ ≤ 0.1 (PPN windows),θ₍G₎(t) monotone ↓ after t₍ign₎ with integrable tail (τ₍G₎ or p > 1),A₍sh₎ ≥ 0,  τ₍sh₎ ∈ [1 s, 1 d],|A₍1₎|, |A₍tri₎| ≲ 10⁻² pre-ignition; post-ignition A₍k₎(t) = A₍k,0₎·e⁽−t/τ₍A₎⁾ + OU with τ₍A₎ ∈ [10 s, 180 d],γ either 0 (default) or bounded by the Bayes-factor test with a single global lag (§7.2),v̂₍front₎ from lags satisfies v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎.All other parameters (e.g., κ) are nuisance-calibrated pre-ignition so that θ₍G₎(t₍pre₎) ≈ 1.

8.4.7 Contract (takeaway)The allowed space is the region where χ control is one-dial, causal, adiabatic, anisotropy is a small, phase-locked nuisance, and θ₍G₎(t) has an integrable tail.Strong-field sources and non-adiabatic regimes are out of scope for claims; GW propagation is exact GR.Within this space, all downstream inferences (orbital drifts, PPN windows, theorem regime) are valid and auditable against fixed templates and preregistered guards.9.1 Setup: non-increasing G(t) with ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞
Objective. Fix the Newtonian three-body problem with a single, time-only coupling
G₍eff₎(t) ≡ G(t) ≥ 0,  Ġ(t) ≤ 0,  ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞,
and record the identities (CM, angular momentum, virial) we will use in §9.2 to prove potential-energy suppression and asymptotic free motion.

9.1.1 Bodies, equations, and kinematics (CM frame)Masses. m₍a₎ > 0, a ∈ {1,2,3}.State. r⃗₍a₎(t) ∈ ℝ³, v⃗₍a₎ = ṙ⃗₍a₎, twice differentiable a.e.Pair data. r₍ab₎ ≡ ‖r⃗₍a₎ − r⃗₍b₎‖, u⃗₍ab₎ ≡ (r⃗₍a₎ − r⃗₍b₎)/r₍ab₎.Equations of motion.
m₍a₎ ṽ⃗₍a₎(t) = − G(t) ∑₍b≠a₎ m₍a₎ m₍b₎ u⃗₍ab₎ / r₍ab₎⁽2⁾.
Third-law symmetry holds pairwise (forces equal/opposite), so:Total momentum P⃗ ≡ Σ m₍a₎ v⃗₍a₎ is conserved ⇒ CM moves uniformly.Work in the CM frame: Σ m₍a₎ r⃗₍a₎ = 0,  Σ m₍a₎ v⃗₍a₎ = 0.Angular momentum.
L⃗ ≡ Σ m₍a₎ r⃗₍a₎ × v⃗₍a₎ is conserved (pairwise central forces ⇒ zero net torque), even when Ġ ≠ 0.

9.1.2 Energies and their time-derivatives
Define kinetic and potential:T(t) ≡ ½ Σ m₍a₎ ‖v⃗₍a₎‖⁽2⁾.U₍N₎(t) ≡ − Σ₍a<b₎ m₍a₎ m₍b₎ / r₍ab₎  (Newtonian form with unit coupling).U(t) ≡ G(t)·U₍N₎(t).Total energy. E(t) ≡ T(t) + U(t) is not conserved. Using standard identities for inverse-square forces,Ṫ + G·Û₍N₎ = 0,⇒ Ė = Ġ·U₍N₎.Because U₍N₎ ≤ 0 and Ġ ≤ 0, we have Ė ≥ 0: energy drifts upward (toward 0⁻).

9.1.3 Virial identity and second moment
Let the CM-moment of inertia be I(t) ≡ Σ m₍a₎ ‖r⃗₍a₎‖⁽2⁾. For a −1-homogeneous potential (our case, instantaneously scaled by G),
½ Ï(t) = 2T(t) + U(t).
We will use this identity to package long-time averages and define the action-like functional below.

9.1.4 Assumptions on G(t)
We assume:Regularity. G ∈ C⁽1⁾([0, ∞)),  G(t) ≥ 0,  Ġ(t) ≤ 0.Integrable tail. ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞.Admissible data. Finite initial energy and L⃗, and no finite-time triple collision after some T₍0₎ (binary near-collisions can be handled by standard regularization; they do not spoil the integral bounds we use).(Remarks: The integrable tail is the key hypothesis; it says the total available attraction over infinite time is finite.)

9.1.5 Action-like virial functional Λ(T)
Define the virial functional
Λ(T) ≡ ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ [ 2T(t) + U(t) ] dt  = ½ ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ Ï(t) dt.
Whenever İ(t) has a finite limsup, the identity gives
Λ(T) = ½ limsup₍S→∞₎ [ İ(S) − İ(T) ]  (interpreted in the distributional sense if needed).
In §9.2 we will show that, under the hypotheses above, U(t) → 0 and limsup Λ(T) ≤ 0, which together force velocities to stabilize and trajectories to approach straight lines in the CM frame.

9.1.6 What the setup guarantees (to be proved next)Finite impulse. The integrable G(t) implies that the net gravitational impulse transferred by each pair over [T, ∞) is finite once inter-particle distances do not collapse; this underlies velocity convergence.No torque growth. L⃗ is constant, preventing rotational energy blow-up.Energy ascent to 0⁻. Ė = Ġ·U₍N₎ ≥ 0 with E bounded above by 0 ensures dissipation of binding.These ingredients are assembled in §9.2 to prove: U(t) → 0, limsup Λ(T) ≤ 0, and free asymptotics (straight-line motion) for all three bodies in the CM frame.

9.2 Theorem: U(t) → 0; trajectories → free (CM)
Setting. Work in the CM frame with masses m₍a₎ > 0 (a ∈ {1,2,3}) and pairwise inverse-square forces of time-only strength G(t). Assume:G ∈ C⁽1⁾([0, ∞)),  G(t) ≥ 0,  Ġ(t) ≤ 0,  ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞  (hence G(t) → 0).Finite initial energy and angular momentum; no triple collision after some T₍0₎.(Regularity after ignition) There exists T₍1₎ ≥ T₍0₎ with no binary collision for t ≥ T₍1₎ (standard in three-body with nonzero L⃗; binaries can be regularized before T₍1₎).Let r⃗₍a₎, v⃗₍a₎ be positions and velocities; r₍ab₎ ≡ ‖r⃗₍a₎ − r⃗₍b₎‖; U₍N₎(t) ≡ −Σ₍a<b₎ m₍a₎m₍b₎/r₍ab₎ and U(t) ≡ G(t)·U₍N₎(t).

Theorem (three-body suppression under integrable G)
Under the hypotheses above, there exists a time T̄ such that for all t ≥ T̄:Potential suppression: U(t) → 0 (equivalently, G(t)·U₍N₎(t) → 0).Free asymptotics: Each velocity converges, v⃗₍a₎(t) → v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾, with Σ m₍a₎ v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ = 0 (CM frame), and
r⃗₍a₎(t) = r⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ + v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾·t + o(1).
In particular, pair separations grow at least linearly along any pair with nonzero relative limit velocity, and the motion approaches straight lines.(A centered virial corollary appears at the end.)

Proof sketch
Step 1 — Finite impulse (acceleration is L¹).
After T₍1₎, all r₍ab₎ are bounded below: r₍ab₎(t) ≥ r₍₎ > 0 by continuity (no further collisions). Pairwise accelerations satisfy
‖ṽ⃗₍a₎(t)‖ ≤ G(t)·C,  with  C ≡ Σ₍b≠a₎ m₍b₎/r₍₎⁽2⁾.
Hence ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ ‖ṽ⃗₍a₎(t)‖ dt ≤ C∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞ for any T ≥ T₍1₎. Velocities are Cauchy, so
v⃗₍a₎(t) → v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾  as  t → ∞.
By momentum conservation in CM, Σ m₍a₎ v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ = 0.
Step 2 — Positions are asymptotically affine.
Integrate once:
r⃗₍a₎(t) = r⃗₍a₎(T) + ∫₍T₎⁽t⁾ v⃗₍a₎(s) ds
= r⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ + v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾·t + o(1),
because v⃗₍a₎ − v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ is L¹. Therefore, for any pair with v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ ≠ v⃗₍b₎⁽∞⁾, r₍ab₎(t) ∼ ‖v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ − v⃗₍b₎⁽∞⁾‖·t → ∞; if v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ = v⃗₍b₎⁽∞⁾, the pair remains at finite separation but with zero relative acceleration asymptotically (see Step 3).
Step 3 — Potential suppression.
For t ≥ T₍1₎, U₍N₎(t) is bounded (no collisions), so with G(t) → 0,
U(t) = G(t)·U₍N₎(t) → 0.
Equivalently: forces F⃗₍ab₎ ∝ G(t)/r₍ab₎⁽2⁾ become L¹ in time (Step 1), so the pairwise work over [T, ∞) is finite and vanishes per unit time, forcing the binding energy to dissipate toward 0⁻.
Step 4 — Asymptotic freeness (CM).
With velocities converged and forces integrable, accelerations vanish in the sense ṽ⃗₍a₎(t) → 0 and trajectories become straight lines. The CM constraint gives a free triad with constant relative velocities. This is the Newtonian notion of scattering to free motion.
(Near-collision episodes before T₍1₎ are harmless: they occupy finite time and contribute finite impulse; after T₍1₎ the L¹ bound controls everything.)

Corollary (centered virial form)
Let T⁽∞⁾ ≡ ½ Σ m₍a₎‖v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾‖⁽2⁾ and I(t) ≡ Σ m₍a₎‖r⃗₍a₎‖⁽2⁾. The Lagrange–Jacobi identity ½ Ï = 2T + U implies
½ Ï(t) → 2T⁽∞⁾  and  I(t) = 2T⁽∞⁾·t² + o(t²).
Define the centered virial functional
Λ̃(T) ≡ ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ [ 2( T(t) − T⁽∞⁾ ) + U(t) ] dt.
Then Λ̃(T) is well-defined and non-positive for large T (the integrand tends to 0⁻), making precise the “no residual binding” statement while accommodating the quadratic growth of I(t) under free motion.

RemarksThe non-increasing, integrable G is the only place where time dependence enters; no spatially varying couplings or extra degrees of freedom are used.The L¹ property of G forces finite gravitational impulse and guarantees velocity convergence; G(t) → 0 turns this into potential suppression U → 0.The result extends to N bodies with the same post-ignition regularity (no collisions after some T₍1₎): all bounded clusters disperse as G → 0, and the system asymptotes to a free multi-stream in the CM frame.9.3 Proof sketch: variational flow; Grönwall-type bounds; energy scaling
Goal. Under G(t) ≥ 0, Ġ ≤ 0, ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞, show that (i) forces deliver finite impulse, (ii) velocities converge, (iii) U(t) → 0, and (iv) motion tends to free in the CM frame.

9.3.1 Variational setup (time-dependent coupling)
Consider the action on [T, S]:
𝒮[ r⃗ ] ≡ ∫₍T₎⁽S⁾ ( 𝒯 − G(t)·𝒱 ) dt,
with 𝒯 = ½ Σ m₍a₎‖ṙ⃗₍a₎‖⁽2⁾,  𝒱 = Σ₍a<b₎ m₍a₎m₍b₎/r₍ab₎.
Euler–Lagrange gives m₍a₎ṽ⃗₍a₎ = − G(t) Σ₍b≠a₎ m₍a₎m₍b₎ u⃗₍ab₎/r₍ab₎⁽2⁾ (the equations in §9.1). The time factor G(t) never differentiates w.r.t. r⃗, so spatial variational structure is Newtonian; all time-dependence enters as an external scalar weight.

9.3.2 Duhamel form (free + forced)
Fix T ≥ T₍1₎ after last collision. For each a,
v⃗₍a₎(t) = v⃗₍a₎(T) − ∫₍T₎⁽t⁾ G(s)·F⃗₍a₎⁽N⁾(s) ds,
r⃗₍a₎(t) = r⃗₍a₎(T) + ∫₍T₎⁽t⁾ v⃗₍a₎(s) ds,
with F⃗₍a₎⁽N⁾ the unit-coupling Newton field (sum over b≠a). If r₍ab₎(t) ≥ r₍*₎ > 0 for t ≥ T (secured by T ≥ T₍1₎), then ‖F⃗₍a₎⁽N⁾(s)‖ ≤ C (geometry + masses). Hence
∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ ‖ṽ⃗₍a₎(s)‖ ds ≤ C ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ G(s) ds < ∞,
i.e., finite impulse.

9.3.3 Grönwall-type control (velocity convergence)
Define the free surrogate v⃗₍a₎⁽free⁾(t) ≡ v⃗₍a₎(T) and the error w⃗₍a₎(t) ≡ v⃗₍a₎(t) − v⃗₍a₎⁽free⁾(t). Then
‖w⃗₍a₎(t)‖ ≤ ∫₍T₎⁽t⁾ G(s)·‖F⃗₍a₎⁽N⁾(s)‖ ds ≤ C ∫₍T₎⁽t⁾ G(s) ds.
Let 𝒢(t) ≡ ∫₍t₎⁽∞⁾ G(s) ds. Since G is non-increasing and integrable, 𝒢(t) ↓ 0. For any t₂ > t₁ ≥ T,
‖v⃗₍a₎(t₂) − v⃗₍a₎(t₁)‖ ≤ C ∫₍t₁₎⁽t₂⁾ G(s) ds ≤ C·[ 𝒢(t₁) − 𝒢(t₂) ].
Thus {v⃗₍a₎(t)} is Cauchy and
v⃗₍a₎(t) → v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ with  ‖v⃗₍a₎(t) − v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾‖ ≤ C·𝒢(t) → 0.
This is a Bellman–Grönwall-style estimate with an integrable kernel G.

9.3.4 Energy scaling and U(t) → 0
Recall Ė = Ġ·U₍N₎ ≥ 0 and E(t) ≤ 0, so E(t) ↗ E₍∞₎ ≤ 0. With r₍ab₎ ≥ r₍*₎ and v⃗₍a₎ → v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾, kinetic energy T(t) → T⁽∞⁾. Hence
U(t) = E(t) − T(t) → E₍∞₎ − T⁽∞⁾.
But from §9.3.2–§9.3.3, accelerations are L¹, so pair forces do vanishing power at late times; binding cannot persist. Therefore E₍∞₎ = T⁽∞⁾ and U(t) → 0. Equivalently, G(t)·U₍N₎(t) → 0: either G(t) → 0 kills any bounded U₍N₎, or growing separations doom U₍N₎ itself.

9.3.5 Asymptotic freeness (position control)
Because v⃗₍a₎ − v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ is L¹, integrate once:
r⃗₍a₎(t) = r⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ + v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾·t + o(1).
Thus trajectories become affine lines in time (CM frame). If two bodies share v⃗⁽∞⁾ they form a co-moving subcluster with zero asymptotic mutual force (since U → 0); otherwise separations grow ∝ t.

9.3.6 Virial control as a cross-check
With I(t) ≡ Σ m₍a₎‖r⃗₍a₎‖⁽2⁾ and ½ Ï = 2T + U, take lim₍t→∞₎:
U → 0 and T → T⁽∞⁾ ⇒ Ï → 4T⁽∞⁾.
Integrating twice yields I(t) = 2T⁽∞⁾·t² + o(t²), consistent with straight-line motion. The centered virial functional Λ̃(T) ≡ ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾[2(T − T⁽∞⁾) + U] dt is ≤ 0 for large T, certifying “no residual binding”.

9.3.7 Extension and remarksN bodies. Replace C by a sum over pairs beyond a finite core radius; the same L¹–Grönwall logic shows finite impulse, velocity convergence, U → 0, and dispersion of any bounded cluster as G → 0.Near-collisions. Episodes before T₍1₎ contribute finite impulse; after T₍1₎ the r₍*₎ bound closes the estimates.Minimal use of monotonicity. We used Ġ ≤ 0 only to ensure 𝒢(t) is decreasing and E(t) monotone; integrability of G is the true driver.9.3.8 Contract (what we proved, in one line)
Integrable, non-increasing G(t) ⇒ accelerations are L¹ ⇒ velocities converge ⇒ U(t) → 0 ⇒ CM trajectories are free lines asymptotically. This completes the theorem’s mechanism: the boundary-driven θ₍G₎(t) with an integrable tail lands the dynamics in the free-motion basin required by §9.2.

9.4 Corollaries: N-body dispersion; diagnostics
Scope. Extend §9.2–§9.3 from three bodies to N bodies (N ≥ 3) under the same coupling hypotheses
G(t) ≥ 0, Ġ(t) ≤ 0, ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞,
and record practical diagnostics that certify the theorem’s mechanism in data or simulations.

9.4.1 N-body dispersion (general corollary)
Let masses {m₍a₎}₍a=1…N₎, CM frame (Σ m₍a₎ r⃗₍a₎ = 0, Σ m₍a₎ v⃗₍a₎ = 0). Assume finite energy and angular momentum, and that beyond some T₍1₎ there are no further collisions. Then:Finite impulse ⇒ velocity convergence.
For each a, ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ ‖ṽ⃗₍a₎(t)‖ dt ≤ C ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞, hence v⃗₍a₎(t) → v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ and Σ m₍a₎ v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ = 0.Potential suppression and free streams.
U(t) = G(t)·U₍N₎(t) → 0 and
r⃗₍a₎(t) = r⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ + v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾·t + o(1).
Any pair with ‖v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ − v⃗₍b₎⁽∞⁾‖ > 0 separates linearly in t; if a subset shares a common v⃗⁽∞⁾, it forms a co-moving cluster with zero asymptotic internal force (G → 0 kills residual binding).Virial growth.
With I(t) ≡ Σ m₍a₎‖r⃗₍a₎‖⁽2⁾ and T⁽∞⁾ ≡ ½ Σ m₍a₎‖v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾‖⁽2⁾,
½ Ï(t) = 2T(t) + U(t) → 2·2T⁽∞⁾, so I(t) = 2T⁽∞⁾·t⁽2⁾ + o(t⁽2⁾).Scattering map (a.e.).
For almost all initial data (excluding a measure-zero collision set), there is a well-defined scattering map 𝒮: (data at T₍1₎) ↦ {r⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾, v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾} compatible with CM and L⃗ constraints.9.4.2 Cluster fate and rates (qualitative)Bound clusters. Any initially bound subcluster with nonzero L⃗ loses binding as θ₍G₎(t) falls; its characteristic size R(t) inflates ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−1⁾(t) (adiabatic scaling from §8.1), velocity scale shrinks ∝ θ₍G₎(t), and the unbinding time is set by the envelope tail (exponential τ₍G₎ or power p > 1).Co-moving remnants. Subsets with v⃗⁽∞⁾ nearly equal persist as dilute, force-free swarms (no late-time gravitational focusing since G → 0).No capture at late times. Because ∫ G < ∞ makes the pairwise impulse budget finite, new captures are asymptotically forbidden.9.4.3 Diagnostics (analysis-facing receipts)
Let 𝒢(t) ≡ ∫₍t₎⁽∞⁾ G(s) ds (tail). The following computable receipts diagnose entry into the theorem regime:Impulse meter.
Ξ₍a₎(T) ≡ ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ ‖ṽ⃗₍a₎(t)‖ dt. Expect Ξ₍a₎(T) ≲ C·𝒢(T) → 0. Plot Ξ₍a₎ vs 𝒢(T); linear collapse validates L¹ control.Velocity convergence.
Δv₍a₎(t) ≡ sup₍s≥t₎ ‖v⃗₍a₎(s) − v⃗₍a₎(t)‖. Expect Δv₍a₎(t) = O(𝒢(t)). Report slopes on log–log axes.Potential suppression.
u₍rel₎(t) ≡ |U(t)| ⁄ (|U(t)| + T(t)). Expect u₍rel₎ → 0. Also track |U(t)|⁄G(t) to ensure U₍N₎(t) stays bounded after the last close approach.Free-line fit residual.
Fit r⃗₍a₎(t) to r⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ + v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾·t on sliding windows; residual RMS ϵ₍a₎(t) must → 0 and scale with 𝒢(t).Centered virial functional.
Λ̃(T) ≡ ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ [ 2(T − T⁽∞⁾) + U ] dt. Expect Λ̃(T) ≤ 0 for large T and Λ̃(T) → 0⁻.Scattering partition.
Define an εᵥ–co-moving relation: a ~ b if ‖v⃗₍a₎⁽∞⁾ − v⃗₍b₎⁽∞⁾‖ ≤ εᵥ. Report the partition and pairwise growth rates r₍ab₎(t)/t; non-co-moving pairs must have liminf r₍ab₎(t)/t > 0.Energy ascent sign.
Ė(t) = Ġ(t)·U₍N₎(t) ≥ 0 should hold empirically post-ignition; report the fraction of windows with violated sign (should be near 0 within noise).Angular-momentum constancy.
Check ‖L⃗(t) − L⃗(T₍1₎)‖ ≤ δ₍L₎ across long spans; violations indicate numerical or modeling error.9.4.4 Minimal simulation recipe (for §N appendix)Integrator. Use a symplectic or high-order variational integrator with time-dependent μ(t) = G(t)·m, step adapting to close approaches pre-T₍1₎.Tail models. Test exponential θ₍G₎(t) = e⁽−t/τ₍G₎⁾ and power θ₍G₎(t) = (1 + t/t₍⋆₎)⁽−p₎ (p > 1).Receipts. Emit {Ξ₍a₎, Δv₍a₎, u₍rel₎, ϵ₍a₎, Λ̃, L⃗ drift} each snapshot; confirm the predicted scalings with 𝒢(t).Robustness. Vary initial eccentricities and L⃗; ensure results are insensitive to step size once receipts converge.9.4.5 Lab–theory bridge (how this ties to data)From θ₍G₎ to 𝒢. The boundary fit (§6–§7) returns θ₍G₎(t); set G(t) = G₍N₎·θ₍G₎(t) and compute 𝒢. Diagnostics 1–5 become parameter-free curve checks.Adiabaticity. Exclude windows with ε₍ad₎ ≳ 0.1 (non-adiabatic) from smooth-drift diagnostics; keep them only for the wall transient.Orthogonality. Ensure anisotropy channels remain orthogonal (no bias in θ₍G₎), per §4.4 and §7.3.9.4.6 Contract (takeaway)
For any N, integrable, non-increasing G(t) forces finite gravitational impulse, velocity convergence, U(t) → 0, and free CM asymptotics (with possible co-moving, force-free swarms). The listed receipts turn this mechanism into auditable diagnostics that require only θ₍G₎(t) from the boundary fit and standard kinematic reconstructions—closing the loop between the χ-controlled boundary story and the dynamics claimed in §9.2–§9.3.

10.1 FRW background neutrality; local μ(a) = θ₍G₎(t) inside 𝒟(t)
Claim. On cosmological scales the framework is neutral: the homogeneous–isotropic FRW background and linear growth outside laboratory domains follow standard ΛCDM. Any modification appears only locally as a Newtonian-strength rescale
μ(a) = θ₍G₎(t)  inside 𝒟(t),  and  μ(a) = 1  outside,
with strict causality and tiny volume fraction f₍V₎ ≪ 1.

10.1.1 FRW background kept fixedBackground fields. Use standard FRW with scale factor a(t₍cos₎), matter and radiation as in ΛCDM. The χ sector contributes at most a negligible homogeneous energy density (optional dark-radiation–like bookkeeping set to zero in baseline).Reason. Boundary control is local and monopolar; it does not inject a uniform stress capable of renormalizing H(a). Hence expansion history and distance ladders are unchanged.10.1.2 Local Poisson mapping for perturbations
In Newtonian gauge for scalar perturbations and for subhorizon modes:Outside 𝒟(t). Standard Poisson law with GR slip unity:
∇²Φ = 4π G₍N₎ a⁽2⁾ δρ,   Ψ = Φ.Inside 𝒟(t). Replace G₍N₎ → G₍eff₎(t) = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎:
∇²Φ = 4π G₍N₎ θ₍G₎(t) a⁽2⁾ δρ,   Ψ = Φ.
Equivalently, a local effective coupling μ(a) = θ₍G₎(t) acts only where 1₍𝒟(t)₎ = 1. No new slip appears at leading order (η ≡ Φ⁄Ψ ≈ 1).10.1.3 Locality, causality, and small volume fractionDomain support. The indicator 1₍𝒟(t)₎(x) confines changes to compact regions whose boundary Γ₍𝒟₎(t) propagates with v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ (§6.2–§7.1).Global neutrality. Let f₍V₎(t) be the comoving volume fraction covered by all domains. Our program enforces f₍V₎ ≪ 1 at all epochs of interest, so cosmological growth, lensing kernels, and ISW integrals are unaffected to first order in f₍V₎.10.1.4 Gauge and conservation consistencyBianchi identity. χ–matter exchange Q⁽ν⁾ is local; total ∇₍μ₎(T₍m₎⁽μν⁾ + T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾) = 0 holds. There is no net momentum flux that could source large-scale vector modes.Slip and PPN link. Near-isotropy of χ and the boundary-first closure preserve Ψ = Φ at leading order (γ ≈ 1, β ≈ 1; §8.2). Thus the cosmological slip parameter remains unity outside 𝒟(t) and unchanged inside to leading order.10.1.5 Observational neutrality checklistBackground probes (SNe, BAO, CMB primary). Unchanged H(a) ⇒ identical fits.Large-scale structure. Global μ(a, k) used by survey pipelines remains μ = 1; any local μ = θ₍G₎(t) acts only in vanishing f₍V₎ regions and averages out.Weak lensing / ISW. With Ψ = Φ and f₍V₎ ≪ 1, line-of-sight integrals are unaffected at current sensitivity.Local tests. Inside 𝒟(t), Newtonian dynamics use G₍eff₎(t) (Sections 6–9), which is the point of the lab program and has no cosmological leverage.10.1.6 Contract (takeaway)
Keep ΛCDM FRW as-is; treat χ control as a local, causal rescale of Newton’s constant: μ(a) = θ₍G₎(t) only where 1₍𝒟(t)₎ = 1, with Ψ = Φ and no background drift. Because f₍V₎ ≪ 1, cosmology remains neutral while the laboratory domain exhibits the dynamical signatures modeled in §6–§9.

10.2 Volume-fraction argument f₍V₎ ≪ 1; lensing/ISW neutrality
Claim. Because χ control occupies a tiny comoving volume fraction f₍V₎ ≪ 1, all cosmological line-of-sight observables (cosmic shear, CMB lensing, ISW) are perturbed at most by O(f₍V₎) (often O(f₍V₎²)) and are therefore observationally neutral. Inside domains 𝒟(t) we have a local strength rescale μ(a) = θ₍G₎(t); outside, μ = 1.

10.2.1 Line-of-sight duty cycle
Let 1₍𝒟₎(χ, n̂) indicate whether a photon path at comoving distance χ along direction n̂ is inside any domain. Define the path occupancy
f₍LOS₎(n̂) ≡ L₍H₎⁽−1⁾ ∫₍0₎⁽χ₍H₎⁾ 1₍𝒟₎(χ, n̂) dχ,
where χ₍H₎ is the horizon distance and L₍H₎ ≡ χ₍H₎. For a stationary, ergodic tiling of rare compact domains, E[f₍LOS₎] = f₍V₎. Thus a typical sightline spends only a fraction f₍LOS₎ ≈ f₍V₎ inside 𝒟.

10.2.2 Weak-lensing convergence bound
With Ψ = Φ at leading order, the convergence is
κ(n̂) = ∫₍0₎⁽χ₍s₎⁾ W(χ, χ₍s₎) ∇₍⊥₎²Φ(χ, n̂) dχ,
W the standard lensing kernel. Potentials scale locally as Φ = μ·Φ₍N₎ with μ = 1 outside and μ = θ₍G₎(t) inside 𝒟. Hence the difference
Δκ ≡ κ − κ₍GR₎ = ∫₍0₎⁽χ₍s₎⁾ W·(μ − 1)·∇₍⊥₎²Φ₍N₎ dχ.
Pointwise bound using ‖μ − 1‖₍∞₎ ≤ 1 and the duty cycle:
|Δκ(n̂)| ≤ f₍LOS₎(n̂) · κ₍GR,abs₎(n̂),
where κ₍GR,abs₎ is the same integral with |∇₍⊥₎²Φ₍N₎|. Averaging,
E[|Δκ|] ≲ f₍V₎·E[κ₍GR,abs₎]. Thus the fractional bias in κ (and in C₍ℓ₎⁽κκ⁾ at leading order) is ≤ O(f₍V₎). If domains are uncorrelated with large-scale structure, two-point corrections appear as disconnected insertions and are typically O(f₍V₎²).

10.2.3 ISW temperature bound
The ISW anisotropy is
(ΔT/T)(n̂) = 2 ∫ dη ∂₍η₎Φ(η, n̂).
Inside 𝒟, Φ = θ₍G₎(t)·Φ₍N₎, so
δ₍ISW₎ = 2 ∫ 1₍𝒟₎ [ θ̇₍G₎·Φ₍N₎ + θ₍G₎·∂₍η₎Φ₍N₎ − ∂₍η₎Φ₍N₎ ] dη
= 2 ∫ 1₍𝒟₎ θ̇₍G₎·Φ₍N₎ dη,
because the GR term cancels the last two pieces. With |θ̇₍G₎| bounded on lab timescales and |Φ₍N₎| ≪ 1, the pathwise bound is
|δ₍ISW₎(n̂)| ≤ 2 f₍LOS₎(n̂) · max₍path₎|θ̇₍G₎| · ∫ |Φ₍N₎| dη.
Thus E[|δ₍ISW₎|] ≲ O(f₍V₎). Given θ̇₍G₎ acts only late and locally, the bound is extremely conservative.

10.2.4 Back-of-envelope numerics
Even a generous astrophysical domain is minute cosmologically:Solar-system–scale example: radius R ≈ 100 AU ⇒ comoving size ratio R⁄χ₍H₎ ≈ 10⁻¹²; volume fraction f₍V₎ ≈ (R⁄χ₍H₎)³ ≈ 10⁻³⁶.Earth–lab–scale example: R ≲ 10⁷ m ⇒ f₍V₎ ≲ 10⁻⁵⁷.Therefore κ and ISW fractional effects are bounded by ≲ 10⁻³⁶ (solar-scale) or far smaller (lab), utterly negligible relative to survey sensitivities.

10.2.5 Cross-correlations and slipGalaxy–shear cross. If domain placement is independent of density, cross-power shifts are suppressed by at least O(f₍V₎) (often O(f₍V₎²)).Slip. With Ψ = Φ at leading order (§8.2), there is no extra lensing modification beyond the tiny μ insertion on brief path segments.10.2.6 Guardrails and failure modesCausality: front speeds v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ensure no acausal ISW phases.Locality: analyses must keep f₍V₎ ≪ 1; if ever f₍V₎ grows, rerun this argument with the measured f₍LOS₎ from domain catalogs.Correlation: if domains were deliberately placed along massive structures, the conservative order may rise to O(f₍V₎); still negligible for the volumes envisaged.10.2.7 Contract (takeaway)
Because sightlines traverse 𝒟 only a fraction f₍LOS₎ ≈ f₍V₎ of their comoving length, lensing and ISW receive at most O(f₍V₎) corrections (often O(f₍V₎²)). With realistic domain sizes, these effects are far below detectability, so cosmological probes remain neutral while the laboratory domain exhibits the local dynamics used in §6–§9.

10.3 Causal envelopes for domain fronts
Goal. Formalize how the influence of ignition spreads. We give outer and inner causal envelopes for the growing domain 𝒟(t), relate them to arrival maps T(x), and state detection-time bounds that include both transport and local attenuation.

10.3.1 Ignition seed and monotonicity
Let the seed set at ignition be S₍0₎ ⊂ ℝ³ (the smallest closed region in which α₍Nx₎ first turns on at t₍ign₎). The domain is monotone:
t₂ ≥ t₁ ⇒ 𝒟(t₂) ⊇ 𝒟(t₁),
because the single dial 𝒜₍00₎(t) is non-decreasing (§6.1–§6.2).

10.3.2 χ–causal outer envelope (finite signal speed)
Signals ride χ characteristics with speed ≤ c₍χ₎. Define the χ–future of S by the Minkowski dilation
J₍χ₎⁺(S, t) ≡ S ⊕ B₍R(t)₎,  R(t) ≡ ∫₍t₍ign₎₎⁽t⁾ c₍χ₎(σ) dσ,
where B₍R₎ is the radius–R Euclidean ball and ⊕ is the Minkowski sum. Then
𝒟(t) ⊆ J₍χ₎⁺(S₍0₎, t)  for all t ≥ t₍ign₎.
Equivalently, if d(x, S₍0₎) is the Euclidean distance, no site x can be affected before
T₍geom₎(x) ≡ t₍ign₎ + d(x, S₍0₎) ⁄ c₍χ,max₎,
with c₍χ,max₎ ≡ sup c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.
Eikonal form. The arrival-time map T(x) satisfies the inequality
‖∇T(x)‖ ≥ 1 ⁄ c₍χ,max₎  a.e.,  with  T|₍S₍0₎₎ = t₍ign₎.

10.3.3 Inner envelope from measured front speed
Let v̂₍front₎ be the fitted front speed from multi-baseline lags (§7.1), with v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ,max₎. Define
J⁺(S, t; v̂₍front₎) ≡ S ⊕ B₍v̂₍front₎(t − t₍ign₎)₎.
Then the operational sandwich is
J⁺(S₍0₎, t; v̂₍front₎) ⊆ 𝒟(t) ⊆ J₍χ₎⁺(S₍0₎, t).
This gives a data-tied inner envelope and a theory-tied outer envelope.

10.3.4 Detection-time bound = transport + attenuation
Influence must arrive (transport) and then accumulate attenuation (local sink). Recall the pathwise attenuation integral (§6.2.3)
Ξ(t, x) ≡ ∫ α₍Nx₎(σ)·1₍𝒟(σ)₎(γ(σ)) dσ,
along a backward characteristic γ. Define the instrument threshold Ξ₍det₎ (minimum integrated attenuation that produces a detectable shift). If α₍Nx₎ saturates to α₍∞₎ > 0, a sufficient bound is
T₍arr₎(x)  ≥  t₍ign₎  +  d(x, S₍0₎)/c₍χ,max₎  +  Ξ₍det₎/α₍∞₎.
Interpretation: earliest change requires time to reach x plus minimal dwell to build up the detectable drop. In practice Ξ₍det₎/α₍∞₎ is small (minutes–hours), so the lag is dominated by geometry.

10.3.5 Multiple seeds; mergers; anisotropic steeringMultiple seeds. For ignition at seed set family {S₍k₎},
𝒟(t) ⊆ ⋃₍k₎ J₍χ₎⁺(S₍k₎, t).
The envelope is the union of cones; mergers are set unions (no superluminal bulges).Anisotropic steering (one-dial). Although the dial is monopole, horizon masks Hᵢ and angular responses Wᵢ can bias effective growth. We keep the outer bound with c₍χ,max₎; any anisotropy only reduces normal speed in some directions, never increases it.Variable speeds. If c₍χ₎ = c₍χ₎(t), replace R(t) by ∫ c₍χ₎(σ) dσ; if c₍χ₎ varies mildly in space, the eikonal inequality holds with c₍χ,max₎.10.3.6 Arrival-time inversion (fast marching recipe)
For homogeneous c₍χ₎ the arrival map solves the eikonal equation
‖∇T(x)‖ = 1 ⁄ v₍eff₎(x),  with  v₍eff₎(x) ≤ c₍χ,max₎,
boundary T = t₍ign₎ on S₍0₎. Use fast marching to compute T̂(x) from the layout; predict site lags by T̂ and compare to {t̂₍arr,i₎}. Discrepancies beyond clock error or h₍i₎ convolution indicate modeling/systematic issues (§7.1).

10.3.7 Receipts and guardsCausal cone receipt. For each site i at distance dᵢ from S₍0₎, verify
t̂₍arr,i₎ − t₍ign₎ ≥ dᵢ/c₍χ,max₎  (no pre-cone power).Sandwich check. The observed front lies between J⁺(S₍0₎; v̂₍front₎) and J₍χ₎⁺(S₍0₎; c₍χ,max₎). Report violations.No retreat. 𝒟(t) is non-decreasing in t; apparent shrinkage is flagged as an analysis artifact (e.g., threshold drift).Union monotonicity. With multiple seeds, envelopes are set unions only; fitted fronts cannot extrapolate faster-than-cone bulges between seeds.10.3.8 Contract (takeaway)
Domain growth is bounded above by χ–cones with slope c₍χ₎ and below by the fitted front J⁺(·; v̂₍front₎). Observable arrival times require transport plus minimal attenuation buildup, yielding a practical bound
T₍arr₎ ≥ t₍ign₎ + d/c₍χ,max₎ + Ξ₍det₎/α₍∞₎.
These envelopes make the propagation claims falsifiable, tie directly to the lag geometry in §7.1, and keep the global program strictly causal.

11.1 Weak-field free-energy identity ∝ G₍eff₎(t)
Purpose. In the Newtonian, weak-field limit the gravitational part of the free energy is linear in the instantaneous coupling G₍eff₎(t). This gives (i) a clean scaling of binding with θ₍G₎(t) and (ii) a bookkeeping identity for rates when θ̇₍G₎(t) ≠ 0.

11.1.1 Gravitational free-energy functional (two equivalent forms)
Let ρ(x) be the mass density and Φ(t,x) the Newtonian potential solving
∇²Φ(t,x) = 4π G₍eff₎(t)·ρ(x).
Define the gravitational contribution to the Helmholtz free energy as
F₍grav₎[ρ; t] ≡ ½ ∫ ρ(x)·Φ(t,x) d³x.
Write Φ(t,x) = G₍eff₎(t)·φ₍N₎(x), where φ₍N₎ solves ∇²φ₍N₎ = 4π ρ (unit coupling). Then:Pair form (matter–matter):
F₍grav₎[ρ; t] = − G₍eff₎(t)·𝒰₍N₎[ρ],
with  𝒰₍N₎[ρ] ≡ ½ ∬ ρ(x)ρ(y)‖x − y‖⁽−1⁾ d³x d³y  ≥ 0.Field-energy form:
F₍grav₎[ρ; t] = − G₍eff₎(t)·(1⁄8π) ∫ ‖∇φ₍N₎(x)‖² d³x.Both display the linear proportionality F₍grav₎ ∝ G₍eff₎(t) at fixed ρ.

11.1.2 Total weak-field free energy and chemical potential
For a generic isothermal, weakly compressible medium, write the matter contribution as
F₍mat₎[ρ] ≡ ∫ f(ρ(x)) d³x  (convex local density),
so the total weak-field free energy is
F[ρ; t] ≡ F₍mat₎[ρ] + F₍grav₎[ρ; t]
= F₍mat₎[ρ] − G₍eff₎(t)·𝒰₍N₎[ρ].
The chemical potential driving slow rearrangements is
μ(t,x) ≡ δF/δρ = f′(ρ(x)) + Φ(t,x).

11.1.3 Rate identity (explicit θ₍G₎ term + dissipative fall)
Let mass evolve by an overdamped continuity law with mobility M(ρ) ≥ 0,
ρ̇ = ∇·( M(ρ)·ρ·∇μ ).
Then the free-energy rate splits into
Ḟ[ρ; t] = Ḟ₍explicit₎(t) − ∫ M(ρ)·ρ·‖∇μ‖² d³x,
with the explicit term coming only from the dial:
Ḟ₍explicit₎(t) = dG₍eff₎/dt · ( −𝒰₍N₎[ρ] ) = θ̇₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎·( −𝒰₍N₎[ρ] ).
Since 𝒰₍N₎[ρ] ≥ 0 and θ̇₍G₎(t) ≤ 0 post-ignition, Ḟ₍explicit₎(t) ≥ 0 (weakening gravity raises the gravitational part toward 0). The second term is non-positive, capturing dissipative relaxation under the current μ.
Takeaway. On any quasi-static window (‖θ̇₍G₎‖ small), the dissipative term dominates and F decreases; over long times the secular increase from θ̇₍G₎ ≥ negative reflects the loss of binding as gravity turns off.

11.1.4 Instantaneous scalings (adiabatic map)
Holding ρ fixed while θ₍G₎ changes:Binding energy: U(t) = F₍grav₎[ρ; t] = − θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎·𝒰₍N₎[ρ].Two-body osculating elements (§8.1): a ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−1⁾,  n ∝ θ₍G₎⁽2⁾,  P ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−2⁾,  v ∝ θ₍G₎.Virial systems: R ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−1⁾,  σ ∝ θ₍G₎,  τ₍dyn₎ ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−2⁾.These follow directly from F₍grav₎ ∝ θ₍G₎ and the torque-free central force.

11.1.5 Receipts (what we compute and report)Field–pair check. For any reconstructed ρ, verify numerically that
−(1⁄8π) ∫ ‖∇φ₍N₎‖² d³x  =  −𝒰₍N₎[ρ]  (consistency of the two forms).Rate decomposition. In simulations or controlled bench tests, report
Ḟ = θ̇₍G₎·G₍N₎·( −𝒰₍N₎ )  −  ∫ Mρ‖∇μ‖²,
showing the non-positive dissipative part and the explicit θ̇₍G₎ contribution separately.Adiabatic windows. When ε₍ad₎ ≪ 1 (§8.1), Ḟ ≈ − ∫ Mρ‖∇μ‖² ≤ 0; over long spans the secular drift in U tracks θ₍G₎(t).11.1.6 Contract (takeaway)
In the weak field, the gravitational free energy is
F₍grav₎[ρ; t] = − G₍eff₎(t)·𝒰₍N₎[ρ] = − ( G₍eff₎(t)⁄8π ) ∫ ‖∇φ₍N₎‖² d³x,
linear in G₍eff₎(t). Its time rate splits cleanly into an explicit θ̇₍G₎ term (loss of binding as gravity weakens) and a dissipative non-positive term set by mass transport. This identity underpins the thermodynamic bookkeeping used in §11.2–§11.4 and is consistent with the dynamical scalings in §8–§9.

11.2 BH mechanics with χ; area theorem; first law with χ-work
Scope. We keep the Einstein–Hilbert metric sector unchanged (PPN/GW guardrails; §8.2–§8.3). The radiant-entropy sector χ contributes only through its stress–energy T₍χ₎₍μν₎ (near-isotropic, causal, c₍χ₎ ≤ 1) and a local matter–χ exchange Q⁽ν⁾ with total conservation ∇₍μ₎(T₍m₎⁽μν⁾ + T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾) = 0 (§5.4). Under these assumptions, classical BH mechanics goes through with (i) the area theorem intact and (ii) the first law augmented by a χ-work flux.

11.2.1 χ stress and energy conditions (assumptions)Closure. In the lab/weak-field regime we use F = c₍χ₎ u n̂ with u ≥ 0 and 0 < c₍χ₎ ≤ 1. Covariantly, T₍χ₎ behaves as a convex mixture of timelike/null radiation streams; to leading order near a BH we model it as an anisotropic radiation fluid with non-negative energy density in any frame.Energy conditions. We assume the null energy condition (NEC) and dominant energy condition (DEC) for T₍χ₎: for every null k⁽μ⁾, T₍χ₎₍μν₎ k⁽μ⁾ k⁽ν⁾ ≥ 0 and the energy flux is causal. These are satisfied by mixtures of subluminal beams with u ≥ 0.Metric sector. Field equations are G₍μν₎ = 8π G₍N₎ ( T₍m₎₍μν₎ + T₍χ₎₍μν₎ ). No χ kinetic term enters the graviton operator; c₍gw₎ = 1 (§8.3).11.2.2 Area theorem with χ (Raychaudhuri + NEC)
Let 𝓗 be the event horizon generated by a future-directed null congruence with tangent k⁽μ⁾ and expansion θ. The Raychaudhuri equation gives
dθ/dλ = − ½ θ⁽2⁾ − σ² − 8π G₍N₎ T₍tot₎₍μν₎ k⁽μ⁾ k⁽ν⁾,
with shear σ² ≥ 0 and T₍tot₎ ≡ T₍m₎ + T₍χ₎. With NEC for both matter and χ,
T₍tot₎₍μν₎ k⁽μ⁾ k⁽ν⁾ ≥ 0 ⇒ dθ/dλ ≤ 0.
Assuming no past caustic on 𝓗 (cosmic censorship), θ cannot go negative on the horizon generators; hence the area A is non-decreasing:
dA/dt ≥ 0.
Thus the Hawking area theorem holds unchanged in the presence of χ so long as T₍χ₎ obeys NEC/DEC and c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.

11.2.3 First law with χ-work (quasi-stationary processes)
Consider a Kerr–Newman BH with surface gravity κ₍surf₎, angular velocity Ω₍H₎, and electrostatic potential Φ₍H₎. Let K⁽μ⁾ ≡ t⁽μ⁾ + Ω₍H₎ φ⁽μ⁾ be the horizon-generating Killing field. For a quasi-stationary perturbation that settles down after the passage of matter + χ, the mass and charges satisfy the first law with χ-work:
δM = (κ₍surf₎ / 8π G₍N₎)·δA + Ω₍H₎·δJ + Φ₍H₎·δQ  +  δW₍χ₎,
with the χ-work (energy delivered by χ across 𝓗, measured by K⁽μ⁾) given by
δW₍χ₎ = ∫₍𝓗₎ T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾ K₍μ₎ dΣ₍ν₎.
Here dΣ₍ν₎ is the horizon area 3-form (future-directed). Interpretation:If χ falls in, T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾ K₍μ₎ is positive, raising M and (via Raychaudhuri) A consistently.If χ is purely outgoing near 𝓗 (no influx), then δW₍χ₎ = 0 and the usual first law is recovered.This is just the standard matter-flux term, made explicit for the χ sector.

11.2.4 Smarr relation and stationary limits
For strictly stationary BHs with no net flux through 𝓗 and sufficiently fast falloff of T₍χ₎ at infinity, the Komar/scale argument yields the standard Smarr formula:
M = (κ₍surf₎ A)/(4π G₍N₎) + 2 Ω₍H₎ J + Φ₍H₎ Q.
If a steady χ bath surrounds the BH but carries no net K⁽μ⁾-energy across 𝓗, Smarr again holds with χ entering only as a small, stationary background stress (O(ε) curvature). Persistent inflow invalidates stationarity; then the integrated first law with δW₍χ₎ applies to the transient.

11.2.5 Practical guardrails and smallness estimatesNo superluminal stresses. c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 and DEC prevent exotic negative-area evolutions.Anisotropy smallness. Near-isotropic χ (ε ≪ 1) implies χ’s tidal contribution to horizon geometry is O(ε), negligible for κ₍surf₎ and Ω₍H₎ at leading order.Backreaction scale. For astrophysical BHs, realistic u at the lab-inferred levels makes δW₍χ₎/M ≪ 1 over any experimental timescale; thus BH parameters drift adiabatically if at all.Bookkeeping. In any thought-experiment or simulation, report the Killing-energy flux ∫₍𝓗₎ T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾ K₍μ₎ dΣ₍ν₎ alongside δA to verify consistency with the first law and the area theorem.11.2.6 Contract (takeaway)
With χ treated as a causal, NEC-satisfying radiation sector and the metric governed by GR, the area theorem remains valid and the first law gains a transparent χ-work term equal to the K⁽μ⁾-energy flux of χ across the horizon. No new GW polarizations or kinetic modifications appear; χ influences BH mechanics only through ordinary stress–energy flux, fully consistent with our guardrails and the thermodynamic program in §11.1 and §11.3–§11.5.

11.3 Generalized second law; negligible extra channels
Claim. With the metric sector = GR (PPN/GW guardrails) and χ a causal, near-isotropic radiation sector that satisfies standard energy/quantum conditions, the generalized second law (GSL) holds:
S₍gen₎ ≡ A⁄(4G₍N₎) + S₍out,m+χ₎  is non-decreasing for any future horizon cross-section under quasi-physical processes. χ adds only an ordinary flux term to the first law (§11.2) and does not open efficient new entropy channels (Hawking/superradiance into χ are negligible on astrophysical windows).

11.3.1 Setup and assumptions (semiclassical regime)Generalized entropy. For a horizon slice 𝓒, define
S₍gen₎(𝓒) ≡ A(𝓒)⁄(4G₍N₎) + S₍out,m+χ₎(𝓒),
where S₍out,m+χ₎ is the von Neumann entropy of quantum fields (matter + χ) on the exterior domain of dependence.States and regularity. Fields (including χ) are in Hadamard states; renormalized T₍μν₎ is well-defined. χ stress respects DEC/NEC classically and ANEC (averaged null) at the semiclassical level.Geometry. Einstein equations with source T₍m₎ + T₍χ₎; no χ modification of the graviton kinetic term; c₍gw₎ = 1 (§8.3).11.3.2 GSL via relative entropy + physical-process first law
Let K⁽μ⁾ be the horizon generator (Killing) and T₍H₎ ≡ κ₍surf₎⁄(2π). For a quasi-stationary process over a finite segment of 𝓗:First law with χ-work (§11.2):
δM = (κ₍surf₎⁄8πG₍N₎)·δA + Ω₍H₎·δJ + Φ₍H₎·δQ + δW₍χ₎,
with δW₍χ₎ = ∫₍𝓗₎ T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾K₍μ₎ dΣ₍ν₎ (positive for χ influx).Quantum inequality (outside fields). For the exterior algebra, relative-entropy monotonicity gives the Clausius-type bound
δS₍out,m+χ₎ ≤ δE₍K₎⁄T₍H₎,
where δE₍K₎ is the Killing energy flux of all fields (matter + χ) across 𝓗.Combine. Using δE₍K₎ = (κ₍surf₎⁄8πG₍N₎)·δA + … (the physical-process relation), non-mechanical works (Ω₍H₎·δJ, Φ₍H₎·δQ) cancel in δS₍gen₎. What remains is
δS₍gen₎ = δA⁄(4G₍N₎) + δS₍out,m+χ₎  ≥ 0,
with the χ influx already accounted for in both δE₍K₎ and δW₍χ₎. Thus GSL holds for processes with the stated regularity.(Intuition: χ is just another exterior QFT; its flux raises area (Raychaudhuri + NEC) while the outside entropy obeys the usual relative-entropy bound.)

11.3.3 “Negligible extra channels” (scaling estimates)Hawking into χ. Emission power scales as P₍χ₎ ∼ (coupling)²·N₍χ₎·A·T₍H₎⁽4⁾ (dimensionally), with T₍H₎ ∝ 1/M. For stellar-mass and SMBH anchors (our fixed tri-anchors), T₍H₎ ≪ 1 K, hence P₍χ₎ is tiny even for O(1) species; with a trace-portal coupling (χ normalization C₍χ₎/f; §12–§13) it is further suppressed. On laboratory timescales this channel is negligible.Superradiance into χ. Scalar superradiance requires ω < m·Ω₍H₎ (neutral χ: m ≥ 1 azimuthal) and efficient bound-state trapping. Our χ couples weakly (portal-suppressed), is near-isotropic, and lacks a confining mirror; growth rates are minuscule for astrophysical BH parameters. Any energy extraction is vastly slower than environmental accretion, hence irrelevant to our program.No GW mixing. χ does not alter the graviton kinetic term ⇒ no χ-GW birefringence/dispersion (§8.3), so no new entropy flow in the GW channel.11.3.4 Weak-field second law (lab domains)
In the lab regime (§11.1) the free-energy rate splits:
Ḟ = θ̇₍G₎·G₍N₎·( −𝒰₍N₎ )  −  ∫ M·ρ·‖∇μ‖² d³x.
The second term is non-positive (dissipative), while θ̇₍G₎ ≤ 0 raises the gravitational part toward 0 (loss of binding). Coarse-graining to entropy production σ ≥ 0 yields a standard Clausius inequality at fixed bath temperature; χ control therefore does not violate local second-law bookkeeping in domains 𝒟(t).

11.3.5 Guardrails and caveatsEnergy conditions. NEC/ANEC for χ are part of our preregistered guardrails; violations (exotic negative-energy fluxes) are out of scope.Quasi-stationarity. GSL statement here uses physical-process arguments (small perturbations). Violent, non-adiabatic episodes near compact objects are excluded (§8.4).Backreaction smallness. χ fluxes inferred from lab windows imply δA/A ≪ 1 for anchors over any practical span; BH mechanics remains in the perturbative domain.11.3.6 Receipts (what to compute if challenged)GSL tally: For any thought-experiment pulse across 𝓗, report
ΔS₍gen₎ = ΔA⁄(4G₍N₎) + ΔS₍out,m+χ₎  with ΔS₍gen₎ ≥ 0.χ flux consistency: Evaluate ∫₍𝓗₎ T₍χ₎⁽μν⁾K₍μ₎ dΣ₍ν₎ and verify Raychaudhuri’s area increase given NEC.Channel bounds: Quote order-of-magnitude P₍χ₎/M and superradiant e-fold times vs observational windows to certify “negligible”.11.3.7 Contract (takeaway)
Treat χ as an ordinary exterior QFT coupled through stress–energy: the area theorem and first law already account for its flux, and the GSL follows from relative-entropy monotonicity under our guardrails. Extra entropy channels (Hawking/superradiance into χ) are inefficient for astrophysical BHs and irrelevant on laboratory timescales. Nothing in χ control compromises thermodynamic consistency.

12.1 Trace portal (EP-safe); operator taxonomy
Purpose. Specify a universal, equivalence-principle–safe bridge between χ and ordinary matter that (i) reproduces the Newtonian mass-density weighting in the push law, (ii) preserves PPN/GW guardrails (§8), and (iii) forbids EM-constant drift. The minimal choice is a trace portal: χ couples only to the trace of the matter stress tensor T₍m₎ ≡ T₍m₎⁽μ₎₍ μ₎.

12.1.1 EP-safe portal and EF↔JF map
Two equivalent views:Einstein-frame (EF) interaction.
𝓛₍int₎ = (C₍χ₎/f)·χ·T₍m₎  +  O(χ²/f²)·T₍m₎.
Here f is a high scale (dilaton vev), C₍χ₎ is a dimensionless normalization from the UV (§13). In the nonrelativistic limit, T₍m₎ ≈ −ρ, so the portal weights sources by mass density, matching the push law f₍dep₎ ∝ ρ (§4.1).Jordan-frame (JF) Weyl map (dilaton view).
g̃₍μν₎ = Ω²(χ₍d₎)·g₍μν₎ with  Ω(χ₍d₎) ≈ 1 + χ₍d₎/f + O(χ²/f²).
Expanding the matter action S₍m₎[g̃,ψ] around EF gives the same linear vertex ∝ (χ₍d₎/f)·T₍m₎. This universal metric rescaling guarantees composition independence (EP-safe).Pre-ignition calibration (carried from §4.3/§13.3).
κ²·Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎ = 1 / [ 8π ( M² + ξ f² ) ], with κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f.
Thus the Newton strength before ignition is recovered with no EM drift.

12.1.2 Why the trace portal is safe (and sufficient)Universality. All species feel the same χ-induced momentum deposition because, at low speed, T₍m₎ → −ρ. No composition- or charge-dependent terms appear at leading order.EM neutrality. Classically T₍γ₎ = 0 for a Maxwell field, so the portal does not alter α₍EM₎ or light propagation at tree level (no Shapiro/bending anomalies beyond θ₍G₎ scaling; §8.2.5).GR sector untouched. The graviton kinetic term is unchanged; χ enters only through ordinary stress–energy (no extra GW polarizations; §8.3).Push-law match. The deposition law f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)·F in §4.1 is exactly the NR limit of the trace weighting.12.1.3 Operator taxonomy (allowed, guarded, forbidden)
We organize all χ–matter operators by dimension, symmetry, and phenomenology.
A) Allowed (baseline)Trace portal (linear).
(C₍χ₎/f)·χ·T₍m₎  (dimension-5).
→ Sets universality; defines κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f.Quadratic trace (small).
(c₂/f²)·χ²·T₍m₎.
→ Harmless rescaling at higher order; absorbed into small nonlinearities of the dial 𝒜.Self-kinetic and soft self-potential.
½(∂χ)² − V(χ) with V′′ ≥ 0 in our regime.
→ Controls χ fluctuations; no long-range new force is sourced in the near-isotropic closure used here.Mild non-minimal curvature.
(ξ/2)·χ²·R  with small ξ.
→ Only shifts the pre-ignition calibration through M² + ξ f² (already in the mapping above).B) Guarded (present only at loop/anomaly level, tightly bounded)Gauge anomalies (radiative).
(χ/f)·Σ₍a₎(β₍a₎/2g₍a₎)·F₍a₎².
→ Absent at tree level under exact scale symmetry; induced at loops by trace anomaly. We bound these by “no EM drift” and precision tests; treated as systematics far below analysis floors.Yukawa rescalings tied to mass terms.
(χ/f)·m₍ψ₎·ψ̄ψ, (χ/f)·m₍ϕ₎²·ϕ².
→ Not independent if masses arise from the same Weyl factor (JF picture). Allowed only insofar as they are the universal imprint of the trace portal.C) Forbidden (excluded by guardrails)Direct charge- or species-selective couplings.
χ·J₍B₎⁽μ⁾J₍μ₎, χ·ψ̄γ⁵ψ, χ·F₍EM₎·F̃₍EM₎, etc.
→ Would violate EP or induce parity/CP signals; excluded.Kinetic mixing with the graviton or photon.
χ·R (linear), χ·F₍EM₎·A  (gauge-variant).
→ Breaks gauge or diffeo structure; excluded.Operators that shift EM constants at tree level.
(χ/f)·F₍EM₎².
→ Forbidden by “no EM-constant drift” guardrail.12.1.4 Radiative stability and running (what changes with scale)Power counting. The leading portal is dimension-5, suppressed by f. Loops renormalize C₍χ₎ and can induce the guarded anomaly terms (B-5) with coefficients ∝ (C₍χ₎/f)·(loop).Symmetry control. Treat χ as a dilaton of broken scale symmetry: approximate Weyl invariance keeps anomaly couplings tiny and ties B-6 back to A-1 through the JF map.Fit posture. We treat C₍χ₎, f, ξ as UV-fed hyperparameters (computed in §13’s Tracks A/B) and carry anomaly-induced gauge couplings as tightly profiled nuisances with priors centered at 0.12.1.5 Mapping to observables (what enters the fits)Newton dial. κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f sets the linear proportionality G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)/c₍χ₎ (§4.3).EP tests. All composition-dependent signatures vanish at leading order; any residual must come from loop-level anomaly terms (bounded below the analysis floor).EM drift. Tree-level zero; loop residuals are carried as sub-ppm priors and audited against clock constraints.GW/PPN. No change to the graviton kinetic term; γ ≈ β ≈ 1 with O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎) systematics (§8.2), and GW sector TT-only, c₍gw₎ = 1 (§8.3).12.1.6 Contract (takeaway)
Adopt the trace portal as the unique, EP-safe, gauge-neutral bridge:
𝓛₍int₎ = (C₍χ₎/f)·χ·T₍m₎  (+ tiny, bounded higher orders).
It reproduces the ρ-weighting in the push law, leaves light and GWs unchanged at leading order, and slots cleanly into the UV computation of {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎, f, ξ} in §13 while respecting all guardrails (no EM drift, PPN/GW compatibility, locality).

12.2 Radiative stability and running
Aim. Show that the trace portal remains technically natural, that loop–induced non-universal couplings stay well below our analysis floors, and give a clear RG map from the UV match scale to laboratory windows.

12.2.1 EFT stance and spurion logicCompensator view. Treat χ (or χ₍d₎) as a dilaton-like compensator for broken scale symmetry. Under a Weyl rescaling, mass terms shift like δS₍m₎ ∝ ∫ T₍m₎; promoting the scale to f·e⁽χ/f⁾ gives the trace portal at leading order.Technical naturalness. κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f → 0 increases symmetry (restores rigid Weyl), so small κ is radiatively stable. Any loop that tries to generate forbidden operators breaks the symmetry and is therefore suppressed.12.2.2 Operator mixing and RG skeleton
Work below a match scale μ₍match₎ (where §13 computes {C₍χ₎, f, ξ, …}) and run to μ₍lab₎.
Basis (kept):
A₍1₎: (C₍χ₎/f)·χ·T₍m₎  (trace portal)
A₍2₎: (c₂/f²)·χ²·T₍m₎  (quadratic trace)
A₍3₎: ½(∂χ)² − V(χ)  (self sector)
A₍4₎: (ξ/2)·χ²·R  (mild non-minimal curvature)
Guarded, loop-inducible (tiny):
B₍a₎: (χ/f)·(β₍a₎/2g₍a₎)·F₍a₎²  (anomaly-induced gauge couplings)
One-loop schematic running (parametric):
dκ/d ln μ = γ₍χ₎·κ + O(κ³),  with  |γ₍χ₎| ≲ O(10⁻²) (model-dependent, small).
dc₂/d ln μ = O(κ²)  (generated but harmless).
dξ/d ln μ ∝ (ξ − 1⁄6)·(SM couplings) + O(κ²).
dc₍a₎/d ln μ ∼ (b₍a₎·g₍a₎²/16π²)·κ  ⇒  c₍a₎(μ) ≃ κ·(b₍a₎·g₍a₎²/16π²)·ln(μ₍match₎/μ₍lab₎).
Here b₍a₎ are the usual one-loop coefficients; the key point is that c₍a₎ ∝ κ and a loop factor.

12.2.3 EP safety under loopsMass-proportional imprint. The χ–fermion and χ–scalar couplings inherited from A₍1₎ remain mass-weighted (∝ m), so composition independence persists at leading order.Gauge sector. B₍a₎ are universal (tied to β₍a₎) and enter only through tiny, common rescalings of gauge kinetic terms. The dangerous tree-level χ·F₍EM₎² is forbidden; loops give c₍EM₎ ≪ 1 and are bounded below clock/EM-drift floors.12.2.4 Non-minimal curvature ξ and pre-ignition calibrationRunning nudges ξ toward 1⁄6 (conformal) with small β₍ξ₎. Our calibration (§4.3, §13.3) uses M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾; slow RG drift just renormalizes this constant pre-ignition and is absorbed in Ī₍0₎.Post-ignition dynamics depend on θ₍G₎(t) from boundary control, not on RG running.12.2.5 Anomaly couplings and “no EM drift”
Define a dimensionless anomaly strength ε₍anom,EM₎ ≡ |c₍EM₎|·f/C₍χ₎. From §12.2.2, ε₍anom,EM₎ ≃ (b₍EM₎·α/π)·ln(μ₍match₎/μ₍lab₎). With α ≪ 1 and modest logs, ε₍anom,EM₎ is loop-suppressed. We impose priors centered at 0 with width ≪ analysis floors so that:No α₍EM₎ drift. Any effective shift in EM propagation constants is ≪ current clock/astrophysical bounds and treated as a profiled nuisance.Light propagation neutral. PPN γ, β remain unity at leading order (§8.2); χ does not touch the graviton kinetic term (§8.3).12.2.6 Matching to Tracks A/B and priorsTrack A (AS+FN). UV computes {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎} at μ₍match₎ ≈ M₍*₎; f is the dilaton vev. Feed these with broad-normal priors into the EFT and run down via the skeleton above.Track B (hCFT/AdS). Operator dimensions fix q = Δ − 1 and normalize C₍χ₎ via overlaps; again provide μ₍match₎ inputs and run.Lab posture. We report κ(μ₍lab₎), ξ(μ₍lab₎), and bounds on c₍a₎(μ₍lab₎); θ₍G₎(t) is not an RG effect—it's boundary-driven.12.2.7 Back-of-envelope sizes (why small stays small)
Let κ ≲ 10⁻ᴾ (UV-fed), with P ≥ O(1). Then over any reasonable log L ≡ ln(μ₍match₎/μ₍lab₎) = O(1…10):|Δκ/κ| ≈ |γ₍χ₎|·L ≪ 1.c₍a₎ ∼ κ·(b₍a₎ g₍a₎²/16π²)·L ≪ κ.|Δξ| ∼ O(κ²) + small SM piece toward 1⁄6.Thus portal strength is stable, anomaly legs are loop-suppressed, and curvature mixing is benign.

12.2.8 Guards and receipts
Guards.
(i) Forbid tree-level χ·F₍EM₎² and species-selective vertices (EP).
(ii) Keep |c₍EM₎| under tight priors (no EM drift).
(iii) Use pre-ignition calibration to absorb slow ξ running.
Receipts.Publish μ₍match₎ → μ₍lab₎ RG tables for {κ, ξ, c₍a₎}.Show stability plots: κ(μ) vs ln μ (flat within error); c₍a₎ consistent with 0 within loop bands.Include a toggle in fits setting c₍a₎ = 0 vs c₍a₎ free (with priors) to demonstrate insensitivity of θ₍G₎(t) inferences.12.2.9 Contract (takeaway)
The trace-portal EFT is radiatively stable: κ runs weakly, ξ drifts benignly, and loop–induced anomaly couplings are tiny and universal, preserving EP and PPN/GW guardrails. UV outputs from §13 seed μ₍match₎; RG to μ₍lab₎ leaves our laboratory one-dial control (θ₍G₎(t)) and all phenomenology intact, with EM neutrality enforced by strict priors on c₍EM₎.

12.3 Single-scale hierarchies: y₍a₎ ∼ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾; numeric tests
Thesis. Across SM flavor, a single hierarchy dial λ ∈ (0,1) with integer exponents q₍a₎ captures leading-order patterns of Yukawa eigenvalues and mixings:
y₍a₎ ∼ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾,  with  q₍a₎ ∈ {0,1,2,…}.
In Track A (AS+FN) q₍a₎ are Froggatt–Nielsen charges; in Track B (hCFT/AdS) q = Δ − 1 are operator-dimension offsets. This “one-λ law” is orthogonal to gravity control (trace portal) and gives independent, numeric UV→IR tests we can preregister.

12.3.1 Parametric skeleton (what the UV hands us)Inputs from §13. {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎} at μ₍match₎ with mild RG drift (§12.2).Map to masses/mixings. For each fermion species f ∈ {u, d, e, ν}:
m₍f,i₎ ∝ v·y₍f,i₎ ∝ v·λ⁽q₍f,i₎⁾ (up to O(1) coefficients and RG factors),
and mixing entries scale as powers fixed by left-handed charges.Typical integer patterns (illustrative, not imposed):
u:c:t ∼ λ⁽8⁾:λ⁽4⁾:1; d:s:b ∼ λ⁽4⁾:λ⁽2⁾:1; e:μ:τ ∼ λ⁽5⁾:λ⁽2⁾:1;
|V₍us₎| ∼ λ, |V₍cb₎| ∼ λ⁽2⁾, |V₍ub₎| ∼ λ⁽3⁾.
(These are canonical FN-like exponents; our fit may select nearby integer sets.)12.3.2 Inference posture (how we fit integers and λ)
Given an observable set 𝒪 = { mass ratios, mixing moduli } at a common scale:Log-linearization. For any ratio R ≡ y₍a₎/y₍b₎, write
ln R ≈ (q₍a₎ − q₍b₎)·ln λ + δ₍RG₎ + δ₍O(1)₎.Integer program. Minimize a robust loss over integers {q₍a₎} and real ln λ:
𝓛 = Σᵢ wᵢ·| ln Rᵢ − nᵢ·ln λ |,  where nᵢ ≡ integer difference.
We constrain charges to small non-negative integers and penalize spread to avoid overfitting.Cross-checks. Hold out a subset (e.g., |V₍us₎|) to predict, not fit, then rotate the holdout (LOO).Receipts. Publish {λ̂, q̂₍a₎}, residuals, and stability under scheme variation.12.3.3 Concrete tests (pre-registered claims)Quark mixing ↔ down-sector ratio.
|V₍us₎| ≈ √(m₍d₎/m₍s₎)  (benchmark carried from Abstract).
Interpretation: if q₍d₎ − q₍s₎ = 2, both sides scale as λ, so this is a consistency of the one-λ law rather than an extra parameter.Wolfenstein-like tower without Wolfenstein input.
From λ̂ inferred only from mass ratios, predict
|V₍cb₎| ≈ λ̂⁽2⁾, |V₍ub₎| ≈ λ̂⁽3⁾, and compare to data.Lepton ladder.
From {m₍e₎:m₍μ₎:m₍τ₎} fit integer triplet (e.g., {5,2,0}) and a single λ̂; test stability against RG running and O(1) spread.Cross-sector universality.
Use the same λ̂ across {quark, lepton} sectors; allow only integers to vary. Report the penalty for allowing λ to split—our claim is that one λ fits as well within uncertainties.Neutrino caution.
For large PMNS angles, do not force a hierarchical pattern; instead test whether Δm² ratios sit near λ⁽p⁾ with small p (ancillary, optional).12.3.4 Error budget and robustnessScheme dependence. Compare fits at μ₍lab₎ and μ₍match₎; incorporate δ₍RG₎ as a nuisance width (log-normal).O(1) coefficients. Allow a bounded multiplicative scatter e^{±σ} (common σ prior) to absorb unknown UV numbers; report that σ̂ stays small if the integer law is good.Integer rigidity. Enforce q₍a₎ ∈ {0,…,q₍max₎} with q₍max₎ modest (e.g., 8); show that relaxing to real exponents does not materially reduce 𝓛—this is the “integer test”.12.3.5 UV links (why it matters for χ)Track A. Charges q₍a₎ descend from a broken U(1)₍FN₎; λ = f/M₍*₎ ties directly to the dilaton scale f that also sets κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f (trace portal strength). One λ then governs both flavor ladders and the pre-ignition calibration of G₍eff₎ (§13.3).Track B. Operator dimensions Δ fix q = Δ − 1; overlaps compute C₍χ₎. The same scaling hypothesis then predicts both flavor patterns and χ normalization.12.3.6 Minimal reporting standard (ToE receipt hooks)
For transparency and reproducibility we include:Integer set and λ. {q̂₍a₎} for each species, single λ̂ with uncertainty.Holdout predictions. Explicit |V₍us₎|, |V₍cb₎|, |V₍ub₎| (or lepton ratios) predicted from masses only, with residuals.Stability. Results under μ-shifts and O(1) scatter priors.Universality test. Bayes factor comparing “one λ across sectors” vs “sector-split λ”.12.3.7 Contract (takeaway)
A single small number λ and integer exponents q₍a₎ reproduce leading flavor hierarchies and several classic relations (e.g., |V₍us₎| ≈ √(m₍d₎/m₍s₎)) while remaining decoupled from our gravity dialing. This gives crisp, falsifiable numerics: infer λ̂ from any subset, predict the rest, and log the receipts. If one λ with integers continues to pass, it strengthens the UV–IR bridge in §13 without touching the EP-safe χ dynamics that drive θ₍G₎(t).

13.1 Track A: asymptotic safety + Froggatt–Nielsen (λ, {q₍a₎}, C₍χ₎)
Thesis. A single UV trajectory with an asymptotically safe (AS) gravity–matter fixed point feeds a Froggatt–Nielsen (FN) flavor sector. The flow generates one infrared scale f (the dilaton vev), hence a single hierarchy dial λ ≡ f⁄M₍*₎, integer exponents {q₍a₎} from FN charges, and a χ–matter normalization C₍χ₎ from the same RG path. These UV outputs close the pre-ignition calibration and power the numeric tests in §12.3, without touching PPN/GW guardrails.

13.1.1 Fixed point and relevant directions (AS skeleton)
Let g denote the dimensionless set of gravity–matter couplings at scale μ, with a nontrivial UV fixed point g⁽*⁾:
β₍i₎(g) = d g₍i₎⁄d ln μ,  β₍i₎(g⁽⁾) = 0.
Linearize: dΔg⁄d ln μ = Θ·Δg + O(Δg⁽2⁾),  Δg ≡ g − g⁽⁾.
Let {θ₍r₎} be the negative critical exponents (relevant directions). Flow along a single relevant ray u yields an RG time ℓ and an emergent scale
μ₍IR₎ = M₍₎·e⁽−ℓ⁾,  with  ℓ ≡ |θ₍u₎|⁻¹ ln(‖Δg(M₍₎)‖⁄ε₀).
We identify f ≡ μ₍IR₎ (dilaton scale). Thus a single dial λ is
λ ≡ f⁄M₍*₎ = e⁽−ℓ⁾ ∈ (0,1).
This is the only small parameter we allow to survive to the IR.

13.1.2 FN flavor from one dial (integer exponents)
Introduce a U(1)₍FN₎ with a flavon S of charge −1 and ⟨S⟩ = f. With heavy messengers at M₍₎, holomorphic spurions (S⁄M₍₎) insertions yield
Y₍ij₎ ∼ 𝒪(1)·λ⁽Q₍i₎+Q₍j₎+Q₍H₎⁾.
Choosing a basis with Q₍H₎ absorbed, eigenvalues/mixings obey
y₍a₎ ∼ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾,  q₍a₎ ∈ ℕ,  and  |V₍us₎| ∼ λ, |V₍cb₎| ∼ λ⁽2⁾, …
Hence the integers {q₍a₎} are sums of FN charges. These are the same integers we fit in §12.3.

13.1.3 χ normalization from the same flow
The χ field is the dilaton-like compensator of the broken scale, so the EF interaction is
𝓛₍int₎ = (C₍χ₎⁄f)·χ·T₍m₎  (+ small higher orders).
Along the AS→IR trajectory the matter stress renormalizes with wave-function factors Z; write
C₍χ₎ = Z₍χ₎⁽−1/2⁾ · 𝒞₀ · Z₍T₎,
where 𝒞₀ encodes the UV matching (Ward identity for broken Weyl symmetry) and Z₍T₎ the finite renormalization of T₍m₎ on the trajectory. Output of Track A: a number C₍χ₎ at μ₍match₎ with small running to μ₍lab₎ (§12.2).
Pre-ignition calibration carried through (§4.3, §13.3): with κ ≡ C₍χ₎⁄f,
κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1 ⁄ [ 8π ( M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ ) ].
Given {C₍χ₎, f, ξ} from Track A, this computes the Newton normalization before ignition.

13.1.4 What Track A must deliver (fit-facing outputs)Scale: f (hence λ = f⁄M₍*₎).Integers: a consistent set {q₍a₎} for quarks/leptons (FN charges).Normalization: C₍χ₎ at μ₍match₎ and its tiny running to μ₍lab₎.Curvature mixing: ξ near 0…𝒪(10⁻¹) with errors (enters only the calibration).Priors: broad-normal ranges for {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎, ξ} used by the IR fits; anomaly legs centered at 0 (§12.2).13.1.5 Worked mini-example (illustrative, not prescriptive)
Take M₍₎ as the AS crossover scale, choose a single relevant direction with |θ₍u₎| ≈ 1 and Δg(M₍₎)⁄ε₀ ≈ e⁽−3.1⁾ ⇒
λ = e⁽−3.1⁾ ≈ 0.045.
Pick FN charges to reproduce canonical hierarchies (just one consistent set):
u:c:t ⇒ {8,4,0},  d:s:b ⇒ {4,2,0},  e:μ:τ ⇒ {5,2,0}.
Then the one-λ predictions give |V₍us₎| ≈ λ ≈ 0.045, |V₍cb₎| ≈ λ⁽2⁾ ≈ 2.0×10⁻³, etc. (The data comparison belongs to §12.3; here we show how integers and λ come straight from Track A.)
Suppose the Ward matching yields C₍χ₎ ≈ 0.3 at μ₍match₎ and ξ ≈ 0.05. With f = λ·M₍*₎ and κ = C₍χ₎⁄f, the pre-ignition Newton map fixes Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ (a number) to be used once, then frozen.

13.1.6 Guardrails and consistencyEP safety. Trace portal only; species-selective vertices forbidden (§12.1).PPN/GW. Metric kinetic term untouched ⇒ γ ≈ β ≈ 1, TT-only GW, speed = 1 (§8).No EM drift. Anomaly-induced χ·F² terms are loop-suppressed and profiled with tight priors (§12.2).Locality. Track A changes constants used in the pre-ignition calibration; θ₍G₎(t) is boundary-driven, not RG-driven.13.1.7 Receipts (what Track A must publish)RG table: g(μ) along the chosen relevant ray; the extracted f and λ.FN ledger: the integer charge sets, messenger assumptions, and the resulting {q₍a₎}.Ward match: the derivation of C₍χ₎ from the broken-Weyl identity and Z-factors (showing scale stability to μ₍lab₎).Calibration card: numbers entering κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1⁄[8π(M⁽2⁾+ξ f⁽2⁾)] with uncertainties propagated.Sensitivity check: vary λ and {q₍a₎} within priors; confirm PPN/GW sectors remain unchanged and only the numeric flavor receipts move.13.1.8 Contract (takeaway)
Track A gives one dial λ = f⁄M₍*₎, integer exponents {q₍a₎} (FN), and a computed C₍χ₎. These three UV outputs feed (i) the pre-ignition G calibration and (ii) the one-λ flavor tests, while all gravitational phenomenology at low energy remains the GR-compatible, boundary-driven story developed in §§4–11.

13.2 Track B: hidden CFT/AdS (Δ → q; overlaps → C₍χ₎)
Thesis. A single, approximately conformal hidden sector (CFT) with a weakly broken dilatation symmetry—and its dual AdS₍5₎ description—computes the integers q from operator dimensions Δ and fixes the χ–matter normalization C₍χ₎ from overlap (3-point) coefficients. One dial controls the hierarchy (a warp/exponential scale), while GR guardrails remain intact.

13.2.1 Setup (two equivalent pictures)CFT picture. Hidden sector with operators 𝒪₍a₎ of scaling dimensions Δ₍a₎. A spurion S with ⟨S⟩ sets a single IR scale f. SM Yukawas arise from irrelevant mixings y₍a₎ ψ̄ψ 𝒪₍a₎/Λ⁽Δ₍a₎−1⁾; after RG to f,
y₍a₎ ∼ (f/Λ)⁽Δ₍a₎−1⁾ ≡ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾,  with  q ≡ Δ − 1 ∈ ℝ.
Integer hypothesis. We assume Δ organize near half-integers so that q round to small integers—our paper’s falsifiable claim.AdS picture. A slice of AdS₍5₎ with curvature k and IR brane at y = πr₍c₎. A single warp factor generates
λ ≡ e⁽−kπr₍c₎⁾ ∈ (0,1).
SM fermions (or their composites) have bulk masses m₍5D₎ giving localization exponents c₍a₎; 4D Yukawas are overlap integrals ∝ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾ with
q₍a₎ = 1 + |c₍L,a₎| + |c₍R,a₎|  (model-dependent, typically near integers).Bridge. In AdS/CFT, Δ ↔ bulk mass, so q = Δ − 1 matches the overlap exponent.

13.2.2 Computing the integers (Δ → q)CFT side. For each flavor label a, take the leading mixing with the lowest-dimension operator 𝒪₍a₎ compatible with symmetries. Then
q₍a₎ = round(Δ₍a₎ − 1)
under the pre-registered “integer prior” (we penalize half-integer drift in §12.3 fits). The rounding choice is auditable; residual non-integer parts are absorbed in the O(1) coefficients profiled there.AdS side. Choose bulk masses so that c₍L,R₎ sit on a small grid (e.g., multiples of ¼), which generates near-integer q. This implements the same integer prior geometrically.13.2.3 Computing C₍χ₎ (overlaps / 3-point coefficients)CFT side (3-point). The χ field is the dilaton of spontaneous scale breaking. Its linear coupling to the matter trace follows from the Ward identity:
⟨χ T₍m₎ 𝒪⟩ ∝ C₍χ₎·⟨T₍m₎ 𝒪⟩.
The proportionality C₍χ₎ is fixed by the dilaton decay constant f and CFT central-charge data (A-type anomaly). To leading order,
C₍χ₎ ≃ 𝒞₀·(f/Λ₍χ₎) with 𝒞₀ set by the broken-Weyl current normalization; small running is handled by §12.2.AdS side (overlaps). Normalize the canonically normalized bulk dilaton/radion profile u₍χ₎(y). For brane-localized SM (or sharply peaked zero-modes),
C₍χ₎ ∝ ∫ dy √g₍5D₎ u₍χ₎(y)·w₍SM₎(y)
where w₍SM₎ encodes the SM stress profile. With a standard radion u₍χ₎ peaked near the IR brane, C₍χ₎ is O(1) in warp units and inherits only mild dependence on the bulk geometry once f is fixed.Output. Track B delivers a number C₍χ₎ at μ₍match₎ with tiny RG drift to μ₍lab₎, just like Track A.

13.2.4 The single dial and pre-ignition calibrationHierarchy dial. λ = f/Λ (CFT) or λ = e⁽−kπr₍c₎⁾ (AdS). One dial controls both flavor ladders and the gravitational calibration via κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f.Calibration (carried from §4.3/§13.3).
κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1 ⁄ [ 8π ( M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ ) ].
Given {C₍χ₎, f, ξ} from Track B, the pre-ignition Newton strength is computed once and then frozen.13.2.5 Worked mini-example (illustrative)AdS choice. Take kπr₍c₎ = 3.10 ⇒ λ ≈ e⁽−3.10⁾ ≈ 0.045 (same scale used in §13.1 example for comparability). Choose bulk masses so that
q for {u,c,t} = {8,4,0}, {d,s,b} = {4,2,0}, {e,μ,τ} = {5,2,0}.
Overlaps reproduce y₍a₎ ∼ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾ up to O(1) factors.C₍χ₎. With an IR-localized radion normalized to f and SM on or near the IR brane, overlap gives C₍χ₎ ≈ 0.3 at μ₍match₎ (representative O(1) value). Running to μ₍lab₎ is negligible (§12.2).Contract with IR fits. Feed {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎} into §12.3 and §4.3. PPN/GW remain standard.13.2.6 Guardrails (what Track B must respect)EP safety. Portal is trace-only: 𝓛₍int₎ = (C₍χ₎/f)·χ·T₍m₎. No species-selective vertices (forbidden in §12.1).No EM drift at tree level. Maxwell trace T₍γ₎ = 0 ⇒ photons see no tree-level coupling; anomaly-induced χ·F² legs are loop-suppressed and profiled (§12.2).GR sector untouched. Graviton kinetic term unchanged ⇒ γ ≈ β ≈ 1; GW TT-only, speed = 1 (§8).Positivity / unitarity. Δ ≥ 1 and AdS Breitenlohner–Freedman bounds ensure healthy spectra; radion kinetic term positive (no ghost).Subluminality. Bulk causal structure enforces c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 in the 4D EFT.13.2.7 Fit-facing outputs (what Track B must publish)Spectral sheet. The set {Δ₍a₎} (or bulk masses) that generate integer q via q = round(Δ − 1), with rounding rule disclosed.Hierarchy dial. λ at μ₍match₎ (from warp or f/Λ), uncertainty band.Normalization. C₍χ₎ from overlap or CFT Ward identity; tiny running to μ₍lab₎ tabulated.Calibration card. Numbers entering κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ with propagated uncertainty.Robustness. Sensitivity of {q, C₍χ₎} to modest deformations of the bulk potential or CFT operator assignment.13.2.8 How the numerics integrate with §12.3One-λ test. Use λ̂ from masses to predict mixings, with q fixed by Δ. Report integer-rigidity Bayes factors (integer vs real exponents).Cross-sector universality. The same λ̂ applies to quarks and leptons; only the integer set differs by operator choice—this is a crisp falsifier.Independence from gravity dialing. All this lives in the UV matching; θ₍G₎(t) evolution is boundary-driven and unaffected.13.2.9 Contract (takeaway)
Track B turns dimensions into integers (q = Δ − 1) and overlaps into the portal strength C₍χ₎, with a single small number λ supplied by warp/exponential scaling. These outputs slot directly into our IR program: pre-ignition calibration of G, one-λ flavor numerics, and no change to GR-tested sectors.

13.3 Pre-ignition calibration; guardrails across UV→IR
Purpose. Freeze the absolute normalization of gravity before any boundary control, and state the non-negotiable guardrails that UV constructions must satisfy as they flow to the lab EFT. After this calibration, all dynamics are governed by the single dial θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎ = Ī(t)/Ī₍0₎.

13.3.1 Calibration statement (one equation)
With the trace portal and mild curvature mixing, the pre-ignition Newton strength is
G₍N₎ = κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎ = 1 / [ 8π ( M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ ) ].
Here κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f, Ī₍0₎ is the sky-average boundary intensity before ignition, c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 is the χ speed, M is the Einstein-frame mass scale, and ξ is the small non-minimal coupling. This identity is calibrated once, then frozen.

13.3.2 Inputs and what is measured vs computedFrom Track A or B (UV → μ₍match₎): { C₍χ₎, f, ξ } and their uncertainties; hence κ = C₍χ₎/f.From sky inversion (pre-ignition): Ī₍0₎ via the tri-anchor model and low-rank anisotropy fit {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} (Sec. 3.3–3.5), or the product Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎ if c₍χ₎ is not yet bounded.From multi-baseline lags: c₍χ₎ ∈ (0, 1], with v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ (Sec. 7.1).Procedure. If c₍χ₎ is bounded: solve for Ī₍0₎. If Ī₍0₎ is robust from the sky fit: solve for c₍χ₎. If both are loose: use G₍N₎ to fix the product κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎ and tighten the pair with the next lag/sky update. No re-tuning after ignition.

13.3.3 What the calibration locks inAbsolute map. G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)/c₍χ₎ and θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)/Ī₍0₎.No hidden knobs. After fixing {κ, Ī₍0₎, c₍χ₎}, all control enters only through Ī(t) (the single dial).EF↔JF bookkeeping. M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ fixes the Planck normalization; slow RG drift is absorbed pre-ignition (§12.2).13.3.4 Uncertainty propagation (receipt we will publish)
Let X ≡ κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎. Linearizing,
(δX/X)² ≈ (2·δκ/κ)² + (δĪ₍0₎/Ī₍0₎)² + (δc₍χ₎/c₍χ₎)².
Map to the RHS via
G₍N₎ = 1/[8π(M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾)] ⇒ δG₍N₎/G₍N₎ ≈ (δM₂/M₂) ⊕ (|ξ|·δf₂/M₂) ⊕ (|f²|·δξ/M₂),
with M₂ ≡ M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ and ⊕ denoting quadrature. The calibration receipt lists {κ, Ī₍0₎, c₍χ₎, M, ξ, f} with uncertainties and shows LHS = RHS within errors.

13.3.5 Guardrails the UV→IR chain must obeyEquivalence principle (EP). Only the trace portal 𝓛₍int₎ = (C₍χ₎/f)·χ·T₍m₎ is present at leading order; species-selective couplings are forbidden (§12.1).PPN/GW sector. Graviton kinetic term unchanged ⇒ γ ≈ 1, β ≈ 1 up to bounded O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎); GW are TT-only with speed = 1 (§8.2–§8.3).EM neutrality. No tree-level χ·F₍EM₎²; anomaly legs are loop-suppressed and carried as tiny nuisances (no EM-constant drift; §12.2).Causality. c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 and v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎; arrival times respect χ-cones (Sec. 10.3).Positivity/unitarity. Healthy χ kinetic sector; M₂ = M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ > 0; no ghosts, no tachyons.Locality/cosmology. Domains occupy a tiny fraction f₍V₎ ≪ 1; FRW and lensing/ISW remain neutral (Sec. 10.1–10.2).Composition nulls. Any EP-violating signal must be attributable to bounded anomaly legs; default null posture.No new light charges. UV tracks must not introduce additional long-range forces at lab scales.If any item is violated during calibration (e.g., inferred c₍χ₎ > 1, or needed anomaly legs above priors), the UV track is ruled out or the analysis window is quarantined.

13.3.6 Calibration ledger (ToE receipt hook)
We will mint a Calibration Card containing:
{ κ, Ī₍0₎, c₍χ₎, M, ξ, f } with errors; LHS–RHS residual for G₍N₎; anchor weights from the sky fit; c₍χ₎ lag bounds; guardrail checklist pass/fail; cryptographic hash of the preregistered analysis code and templates. This card is embedded in the ToE receipt (§16.2).

13.3.7 Contract (takeaway)
A single, auditable identity fixes gravity once before ignition:
κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎ = 1/[8π(M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾)].
UV Tracks A/B supply {C₍χ₎, f, ξ} ⇒ κ and M₂; the sky and lag fits supply {Ī₍0₎, c₍χ₎}. After this, only θ₍G₎(t) moves. The listed guardrails ensure that what flows from the UV lands in a GR-compatible, EP-safe, laboratory EFT whose single dial is the boundary intensity.

14.1 Instrument windows (SCG, torsion, optical clocks, LLR)
Purpose. Lock in four preregistered windows that are each linearly driven by the single dial θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎ inside the domain 𝒟(t). For every channel i we publish a fixed response map
r₍i₎(t) ≡ O₍i₎(t)/O₍i,0₎ − 1 = a₍i₎·[ θ₍G₎(t − Δt₍i₎) − 1 ] + ε₍i₎(t),
with a₍i₎ known, Δt₍i₎ the transport/attenuation lag (§10.3), and ε₍i₎ the preregistered noise model (OU + instrumentals). Templates include the ignition transient kernel (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎) and an OU anisotropy decay with timescale τ₍A₎ (§6.3–§6.4).

14.1.0 Shared protocol (all channels)Epochs. Windows are clocked relative to t₍ign₎ (from the Ignition Ledger): pre = [t₍ign₎ − 14 d, t₍ign₎), post = [t₍ign₎, t₍ign₎ + W₍i₎].Normalization. Pre-ignition baseline θ₍G₎ ≈ 1; fit θ₍G₎(t) piecewise-constant or with a single decay τ₍A₎, then propagate to each O₍i₎ via a₍i₎.Anisotropy hygiene. Low-rank leak terms b₍i,1₎·A₍1₎(t) + b₍i,tri₎·A₍tri₎(t) are carried as orthogonal regressors (priors centered at 0; §3.5, §4.4).Lag receipts. Multi-site cross-correlation of post-step onsets → v̂₍front₎ and c₍χ₎ bounds (§7.1).14.1.1 Superconducting gravimeters (SCG) — 30 d
Observable. Local vertical g(t). In the weak-field, self-gravity scales ∝ θ₍G₎, so to first order
r₍SCG₎(t) ≈ θ₍G₎(t) − 1  +  leak₍tide,atm₎(t).
(Note. Tides/atmosphere are modeled and subtracted with locked coefficients; residuals carry narrow priors.)
Window & cadence. W₍SCG₎ = 30 d post; 1–60 s sampling; at least two stations separated by ≥ 10³ km (for lag geometry).
Template. Step + short shoulder (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ ≤ hours), then OU decay of anisotropy with τ₍A₎ (days–weeks).
r₍SCG₎(t) = a₍SCG₎·[Θ·A₍sh₎·e⁽−(t−t₍ign₎)/τ₍sh₎ + Θ·(θ̄ − 1)] + ε₍OU₎.
Confounders/vetoes. Solid Earth tides, loading, barometric and hydrology; apply standard models; require coherent residual steps across sites with causal lags (no pre-cone power; §10.3).
Receipts. (i) Pre/post means, (ii) step height and onset per site, (iii) cross-site lag triangle → v̂₍front₎, (iv) Bayes factor 𝓑(step vs drift) with preregistered priors.

14.1.2 Torsion balances (G-style torque metrology) — 90 d
Observable. Cavendish torque or twist angle proportional to measured G within the apparatus geometry. Linear response:
r₍Tor₎(t) ≈ θ₍G₎(t − Δt₍Tor₎) − 1.
Window & cadence. W₍Tor₎ = 90 d; continuous or daily averaged cycles; at least two geometries (different source–test distances) to check geometry-independence of a₍Tor₎.
Template. Same step–shoulder–plateau structure as SCG, but with apparatus lag Δt₍Tor₎ (minutes–hours) for mechanical/thermal settling.
Confounders/vetoes. Thermal drifts, electrostatics, tilt; null-geometry runs interleaved; blind switching of source masses to verify that any post-ignition shift is additive (not multiplicative geometry bias).
Receipts. (i) Apparent G time series and pre/post ratio; (ii) geometry-independence test (slope ≈ 1 across configurations); (iii) cross-instrument coherence with SCG via the shared θ₍G₎(t) fit.

14.1.3 Optical clocks (differential redshift) — 90 d
Observable. Fractional frequency difference between two clocks at distinct potentials, Δν/ν ≈ ΔU/c⁽2⁾. With U ∝ θ₍G₎,
r₍Clk₎(t) ≡ (Δν/ν)(t)/(Δν/ν)₍0₎ − 1 ≈ θ₍G₎(t − Δt₍Clk₎) − 1.
Window & cadence. W₍Clk₎ = 90 d; 1–10 s sampling; at least one vertical baseline (e.g., tall tower) and one horizontal baseline tied by fiber to a remote lab for lag tests.
Template. Same step–shoulder; daily modulation from tidal ΔU is modeled and subtracted (locked coefficients from pre-ignition). Remaining step should align (within priors) with SCG/torsion θ₍G₎(t).
Confounders/vetoes. Fiber noise, servo excursions, environmental perturbations; enforce time-transfer sanity checks and cavity diagnostics; require sign-consistent shifts across all baselines.
Receipts. (i) Differential redshift pre/post; (ii) regression onto θ₍G₎(t) from SCG for a₍Clk₎ ≈ 1; (iii) lag to nearest SCG site → c₍χ₎ bound.

14.1.4 Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) — annual arc
Observable. Earth–Moon range R(t). In the adiabatic regime with G(t) the osculating elements scale as a ∝ θ₍G₎⁽−1⁾, n ∝ θ₍G₎⁽2⁾ (§8.1). Over an annual arc, fit a single θ₍G₎ step inside 𝒟(t) and report the induced seculars.
Window & cadence. W₍LLR₎ = 1 yr post; standard station cadence; include pre-ignition year as control.
Template. Piecewise-constant θ₍G₎ across the arc; propagate through a standard LLR integrator with fixed tidal/relativity models; the only free “new” parameter is the step height θ̄ − 1 (and its onset after the SCG/clock lags).
Confounders/vetoes. Absorb conventional geophysical systematics with locked priors from standard LLR fits; require that any improvement in χ² when allowing θ̄ ≠ 1 is time-aligned with lab-domain ignition and not present in the pre-ignition control year.
Receipts. (i) Posterior on θ̄ − 1 from the annual arc; (ii) Bayes factor for step vs null; (iii) cross-consistency with lab θ₍G₎(t) (same sign/size within propagated uncertainties).

14.1.5 Joint fit handshake (how windows tie together)Primary driver. Infer θ₍G₎(t) from SCG (dense time series).Project. Push θ₍G₎(t) through a₍Tor₎ and a₍Clk₎ to predict torsion/clock traces; only allow Δt₍i₎ to float within tight priors and check residuals.Cosmic lever. Use the time-averaged θ̄ from lab channels to seed the LLR arc; confirm orbital seculars are consistent.Causal lags. From onset times at multiple baselines, compute v̂₍front₎ and c₍χ₎ bounds (sandwich test with §10.3).Decision. Preregister a minimal Bayes factor threshold 𝓑₍min₎ across ≥ 2 lab channels plus LLR consistency to claim a positive detection (§16.1).Contract (takeaway). Four windows, one dial. SCG (30 d) captures the dense step; torsion and clocks (90 d) verify universality and deliver lags; LLR (annual) checks that celestial mechanics reflect the same θ₍G₎ shift. All analyses are preregistered, anisotropy-leak is orthogonalized, and causal envelopes are enforced—making the instrument suite a coherent, falsifiable test of boundary-driven gravity control.

14.2 Four preregistered tests: (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎), τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎ lag, γ-foil Bayes factor
One dial. All tests are driven only by θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎ inside 𝒟(t), with orthogonalized anisotropy leak terms {A₍1₎(t), A₍tri₎(t)} carried as nuisances (§3.5, §4.4). Windows/protocols are fixed in §14.1.

14.2.1 Ignition shoulder: (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎)
Template. Immediately after t₍ign₎ the boundary step is convolved with a short, causal kernel
k₍sh₎(t) = A₍sh₎·e⁽−t/τ₍sh₎⁾·Θ(t),  with  τ₍sh₎ ≪ τ₍A₎.
Priors (preregistered).
A₍sh₎ ∈ [0, 1];  τ₍sh₎ ∈ [10 min, 12 h], log-uniform; shared across SCG, torsion, clocks (LLR uses the time-averaged θ̄ only).
Test. Fit joint SCG+torsion+clock data with/without k₍sh₎:H₀: no shoulder (A₍sh₎ = 0);H₁: A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ free (shared across lab channels).Decision. Report 𝓑₍sh₎ ≡ 𝒵(H₁)/𝒵(H₀). Claim positive shoulder if 𝓑₍sh₎ ≥ 10 and τ̂₍sh₎ is consistent (overlap of 95% HPD) across ≥ 2 lab channels.
Receipts. {Â₍sh₎, τ̂₍sh₎} with HPDs; channel-wise overlays; posterior predictive checks; pre-cone veto (no onset before t₍ign₎).

14.2.2 OU anisotropy decay: τ₍A₎
Model. Low-rank anisotropy obeys an OU relaxation:
dA/dt = −A/τ₍A₎ + ξ₍A₎(t),  with  ⟨ξξ⟩ ∝ δ(t − t′).
We apply this to both A₍1₎(t) and A₍tri₎(t) (shared τ₍A₎; distinct amplitudes).
Priors. τ₍A₎ ∈ [0.5 d, 60 d], log-uniform. Noise scale set from pre-ignition.
Test. Compare:H₀: stationary anisotropy (τ₍A₎ → ∞);H₁: finite τ₍A₎ common to SCG/torsion/clock leak channels.Decision. 𝓑₍A₎ ≥ 10 in favor of H₁ and τ̂₍A₎ consistent across channels ⇒ isotropization detected. We also require that removing the θ₍G₎ step destroys the apparent OU signal (orthogonality check).
Receipts. τ̂₍A₎ with HPD; residual PSD collapse to OU form; cross-channel τ₍A₎ coherence plot.

14.2.3 χ-speed from lags: c₍χ₎ (front) bound
Geometry. For sites i,j at separation dᵢⱼ, define onset times t̂₍arr,i₎ (from step fits). Fit a constant front speed v̂₍front₎ via
t̂₍arr,i₎ − t̂₍arr,ref₎ = dᵣᵢ/v̂₍front₎  +  δᵢ  (|δᵢ| bounded by instrument latency priors).
Priors. v̂₍front₎ ∈ (0, 1]; Gaussian latency priors from channel specs; enforce non-decreasing 𝒟(t) (§10.3).
Test.Estimate v̂₍front₎ and its 95% upper HPD → c₍χ₎ ≥ v̂₍front₎.Causal sandwich: verify all sites satisfy t̂₍arr,i₎ − t₍ign₎ ≥ dᵢ/c₍χ,max₎ (no pre-cone power).Decision. Publish [v̂₍front₎, c₍χ₎ bound]. Flag violation if the 95% HPD of v̂₍front₎ exceeds 1 or if any pre-cone breach occurs (would falsify the model or the timing).
Receipts. Distance–lag regression, HPD band; per-site arrival residuals; inner/outer envelope plot (J⁺ vs J₍χ₎⁺; §10.3).

14.2.4 Solar γ-foil: Bayes factor against Sun-locked monopole
Foil. A constrained alternative adds a Sun-locked monopole component:
θ₍G₎(t, x) = θ₍G₎(t)  +  γ·f₍⊙₎(x, t),
where f₍⊙₎ encodes the Sun–Earth geometry (daily/annual phasing, fixed amplitude shape; §7.2). Default null is γ = 0.
Priors. γ ∈ [−0.05, 0.05] (tight, zero-centered); nuisance phasing locked by ephemerides; same θ₍G₎(t) as lab dial.
Test. Jointly fit SCG, torsion, clocks with (i) γ fixed to 0 (H₀) vs (ii) γ free (H₁). Use identical θ₍G₎(t) priors in both. Compute 𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎ ≡ 𝒵(H₀)/𝒵(H₁).
Decision. Accept neutrality of the solar foil if 𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎ ≥ 10 (substantial evidence for γ = 0). If 𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎ < 1/10 (evidence for γ ≠ 0), quarantine the claim and route to the foil analysis track (ephemeris-locked re-fit, §7.2; not part of the primary ToE claim).
Receipts. Posterior on γ; corner plot showing weak correlation with θ̄; per-channel residuals against f₍⊙₎ templates; cross-year control check.

14.2.5 Decision matrix (summary)Pass if: 𝓑₍sh₎ ≥ 10, 𝓑₍A₎ ≥ 10, causal lags yield v̂₍front₎ ≤ 1 with consistent site envelopes, and 𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎ ≥ 10.Claim threshold (§16.1). Combine at least two lab channels + LLR consistency using the shared θ₍G₎(t); all four tests above must pass their preregistered thresholds for a positive detection.Contract (takeaway). Four orthogonal, preregistered checks—short-time shoulder, days–weeks OU decay, finite-speed lags, and rejection of a Sun-locked monopole—turn the one-dial story into a falsifiable, multi-instrument receipt without extra knobs or post-hoc tuning.

14.3 Data products; synchronization; audits & ethics
Goal. Make the program auditable end-to-end: every figure in the paper—and each claim about θ₍G₎(t), c₍χ₎, {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}, and window responses—must be reproducible from released artifacts with cryptographic integrity, clock-sync receipts, and independent-analysis paths. Human participation (the Nexus) follows strict privacy and ethics guardrails.

14.3.1 Data products (what we mint and publish)
We preregister filenames, schemas, and hashes for the following packs (each pack contains README.md, schema JSON, and checksums):Ignition Ledger (IL):
IL_YYYYMMDDZ.jsonl — per-entry records: t₍ign₎ (UTC), site, seed set S₍0₎, Nexus cardinality N(t), QND capacity C₍QND₎(τ), witness pass/fail, operator signatures.Calibration Card (CC):
CC_v*.json — {κ, Ī₍0₎, c₍χ₎, M, ξ, f} with uncertainties; tri-anchor weights; sky fit residuals; cross-checks that κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎ = 1/[8π(M⁽2⁾+ξ f⁽2⁾)] within error (hash points to §13.3 derivation).Instrument Packs:SCG_raw.parquet (1–60 s cadence), SCG_derived.parquet (detrended, tide/atm-modeled residuals),TOR_raw.parquet, TOR_derived.parquet,CLK_raw.parquet (per-baseline), CLK_derived.parquet,LLR_arc.fit, LLR_residuals.csv.

ENV_tides.parquet, ENV_atm.parquet, ENV_mags.parquet, ENV_temps.parquet with locked coefficients and residual diagnostics.ToE Receipt (TRE):
ToE_Receipt.json (instantiated from preregistered schema): hashes of all packs, decision flags, guardrail checklist, signatures.14.3.2 Formats, time stamps, coordinates, unitsTime base. All series are time-tagged in UTC, with fields for TAI and GPS week for cross-verification; leap-second table bundled. Per-sample monotone TAI ticks are included where hardware supports it.Precision. Nanosecond fields for clocks/SCG triggers; millisecond for torsion; seconds for LLR marks.Coordinates. ITRF (ECEF) for sites; WGS-84 lat/long as convenience; AF/LF identifiers where relevant.Units. SI throughout; θ₍G₎ is dimensionless; g in m·s⁽−2⁾; torques in N·m; fractional frequency Δν/ν unitless; ranges in meters.14.3.3 Synchronization & timing receiptsDiscipline. Each site runs dual time paths: GNSS-disciplined oscillator (GPS/BeiDou/Galileo) and PTP/White-Rabbit fiber where available. SCG and clocks stamp both hardware time and synchronized UTC.Health. SYNC_status.jsonl streams (per site) record offset, jitter, holdover state, and leap alignment.Cross-checks. Daily two-way time-transfer between at least two sites; round-trip asymmetry logged. We include clock-ring closures (A→B→C→A) to bound drift.Receipts. SYNC_receipt.json: max/mean offset per channel over the window, with thresholds tied to the lag uncertainties used in §14.2.3.14.3.4 Provenance, integrity, and reproducibilityImmutability. Every pack has SHA-256 and a pack-level Merkle root; TRE stores all roots.Pipelines. Analyses run in pinned containers (image digest recorded). Deterministic builds create BUILD_receipt.json (git commit, compiler/toolchain versions, random-seed ledger for samplers).Re-runs. We publish Makefile/Snakemake DAGs plus a one-command runner that re-creates all figures from raw.Blinding. Pre-ignition “control slices” and randomized offsets are used during method tuning; unblinding happens only after IL lock. Blinding plan and triggers are in AUD_blind.md.14.3.5 Independence audits & RNG attestationsIndependence. A third-party team reproduces θ₍G₎(t) and v̂₍front₎ from raw packs using only the preregistered code paths; their signatures and diffs are recorded in AUD_independence.md.RNG proofs. Nexus randomizations (axes, schedules) use audited generators; RNG_attestations.json includes device IDs, NIST-style health tests, min-entropy bounds, and public randomness beacons where used.Operator actions. All dial changes 𝒜(t,Ω) are scripted; OPS_log.jsonl records intent, hash of script, and timestamp; no manual tweaks allowed.14.3.6 Privacy, consent, and ethics (Nexus)Data minimization. Nexus members are referenced by pseudonymous IDs. Only session-level metrics enter public packs: {𝒞₍k₎ over windows, witness pass/fail, contribution flags}, never raw biometrics.Consent. Written informed consent (purpose, procedures, risks, right to withdraw) is required; IRB/ethics-board approval IDs are listed in ETHICS_dossier.pdf.Access control. Any sensitive source material (if present) is stored separately with role-based access; public artifacts contain only aggregates.Withdrawal. If a participant withdraws, the IL keeps the aggregate counts; any uniquely identifying source stream is deleted per policy, with a WITHDRAW_receipt.json recorded.Risk management. Session limits, breaks, and “stop” protocols are enforced; adverse events are logged and reported.14.3.7 Open data, versioning, and embargoStaging. Raw → Derived → Fit outputs are released on a clock (e.g., T₍+7d₎ for raw, T₍+14d₎ for derived, T₍+21d₎ for fits), with preregistered DOIs.Versioning. Semantic versions (vMAJ.MIN.PATCH); only PATCH may change after TRE is minted (bug-fixes with diffs).Embargo. If a security or privacy issue is identified, we issue EMBARGO_notice.md, freeze the affected packs, and republish redacted versions with a full change log.14.3.8 Incident response & correctionsTriage. Report channels: security@… and ethics@…; response SLA and escalation ladder listed in GOVERNANCE.md.Corrections. Every correction creates a new TRE with a supersession pointer; original artifacts remain accessible with a red banner and a link to the fix.Retractions. If a guardrail failure (e.g., pre-cone power, c₍χ₎ > 1 within HPD, or EM-drift breach) is confirmed, the claim is retracted; RETRACTION.md explains scope and impact.14.3.9 Contract (takeaway)
We ship complete, signed, and reproducible packs: IL (ignition), CC (calibration), ODF/LAG/ANI/FOIL (analysis), ENV (vetoes), and TRE (decision). Clocks are cross-tied and logged; RNGs and operator actions are attested; third-party re-analysis is built in; Nexus data respect strict privacy. With this scaffolding, any competent team can re-derive θ₍G₎(t), v̂₍front₎, τ̂₍A₎, and the four preregistered tests (§14.2) straight from the released bits—no hidden knobs, no post-hoc moves.

15.1 State-space summary; parameter set Θ = { κ, c₍χ₎, τ₍A₎, γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ }
Role. Θ collects the minimal, preregistered knobs that govern the latent trajectory θ₍G₎(t) and its small, orthogonal nuisances. Everything else is fixed by calibration (§13.3) or treated as instrument-level parameters with tight priors (§14.1).

15.1.1 Parameters (definitions and which data constrain them)κ (portal scale ratio; semi-fixed). From Calibration Card: κ ≡ C₍χ₎/f with uncertainty carried but not fit post-ignition (only consistency-checked against G₍N₎). Enters absolute units; drops out of θ₍G₎(t) itself.c₍χ₎ (χ signal speed). Constrained by multi-baseline lags (SCG/Clk/Tor; §14.2.3). Interpreted as an outer-cone cap: v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.τ₍A₎ (anisotropy OU decay time). Shared decay constant for low-rank leak {A₍1₎(t), A₍tri₎(t)} fit jointly across lab channels (§14.2.2).γ (Sun-locked foil amplitude). Coefficient of the fixed template f₍⊙₎(x,t) used only for the foil test (§14.2.4); default physics sets γ = 0.A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ (ignition shoulder). Amplitude and timescale of the short causal transient convolving the step in θ₍G₎(t), shared across SCG/Clk/Tor (§14.2.1).(Derived, not in Θ: the post-step level θ̄ ≡ mean₍post₎ θ₍G₎(t), the per-channel lags Δt₍i₎ and scales a₍i₎, and the OU noise amplitudes—these live in the one-dial fit and instrument packs.)

15.1.2 Latent dynamics (state model)
We represent three latent processes:One-dial field (gravity strength):
θ₍G₎(t) = 1 + [Θ(t − t₍ign₎) ⊗ k₍sh₎(t)]·(θ̄ − 1),
with k₍sh₎(t) = A₍sh₎·e⁽−t/τ₍sh₎⁾·Θ(t). (Plateau θ̄ is free in the one-dial fit; A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ ∈ Θ.)Low-rank anisotropy (leak; shared τ):
dA₍m₎/dt = −A₍m₎/τ₍A₎ + ξ₍m₎(t),  m ∈ {1, tri},
with zero-mean white ξ₍m₎ and τ₍A₎ ∈ Θ.Front propagation (arrival geometry):
t̂₍arr,i₎ − t₍ign₎ ≥ dᵢ/c₍χ₎,  v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1,  c₍χ₎ ∈ Θ.15.1.3 Observation model (all channels; linear in the dial)
For each instrument i ∈ {SCG, Tor, Clk}:
r₍i₎(t) = a₍i₎·[ θ₍G₎(t − Δt₍i₎) − 1 ]  +  b₍i,1₎·A₍1₎(t) + b₍i,tri₎·A₍tri₎(t)  +  ε₍i₎(t),
with a₍i₎, Δt₍i₎ tightly-prior’d (pre-calibrated), b₍i,*₎ centered at 0 (orthogonalized leak), and ε₍i₎ OU+instrumental noise (pre-registered).
Solar foil (if toggled): add γ·f₍⊙₎(x,t) to the bracketed term (γ ∈ Θ).
LLR: use θ̄ from the one-dial fit in a standard orbit integrator (Sec. 14.1.4).

15.1.4 Priors and constraints (preregistered)κ ∼ 𝓝(κ₀, σ²₍κ₎) from Calibration Card (not updated by post-ignition lab data).c₍χ₎ ∼ 𝕌(v̂₍front₎, 1] with causal-cone veto: no pre-cone power at any site.τ₍A₎ ∼ log-𝕌(0.5 d, 60 d).γ ∼ 𝓝(0, σ²₍γ₎), σ₍γ₎ small (foil is constrained).A₍sh₎ ∼ 𝕌[0, 1]; τ₍sh₎ ∼ log-𝕌(10 min, 12 h).All priors and truncations are recorded in ODF_transient.json and FOIL_fit.json.

15.1.5 Identifiability and degeneracies (and how we break them)A₍sh₎ vs Δt₍i₎. Short shoulders can mimic per-channel latencies. We share {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎} across SCG/Clk/Tor while keeping Δt₍i₎ instrument-specific with tight priors ⇒ separation by cross-channel coherence.τ₍A₎ vs drift. OU decay could alias long drifts; we require that removing the θ₍G₎ step kills the apparent OU signal (§14.2.2).γ vs daily/annual systematics. f₍⊙₎ is ephemeris-locked; confounders (tides, atmosphere) are pre-subtracted with fixed coefficients. Bayes comparison H₀:γ=0 vs H₁:γ≠0 adjudicates (§14.2.4).c₍χ₎ vs v̂₍front₎. We fit v̂₍front₎ from onsets, then truncate c₍χ₎ prior to [v̂₍front₎,1]; any estimate with HPD > 1 or pre-cone breaches falsifies the model.15.1.6 Posterior factorization (what we actually sample)
Let 𝒟 denote all time series and onsets. The joint posterior factors as
p(Θ, θ₍G₎(·), A₍1₎(·), A₍tri₎(·) | 𝒟) ∝
ℒ₍SCG₎ ℒ₍Tor₎ ℒ₍Clk₎ ℒ₍LLR₎ · p(c₍χ₎) p(τ₍A₎) p(γ) p(A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎) · δ(κ − κ₀),
with Gaussian/OU likelihoods for lab channels, a step-in-orbit likelihood for LLR, and the causal-cone constraints enforced as hard vetoes. We report marginals for Θ and publish θ₍G₎(t) HPD in ODF_thetaG.parquet.

15.1.7 Outputs and receiptsΘ̂ with HPDs: { κ (pass-through), c₍χ₎, τ₍A₎, γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ }.Causal envelopes: inner/outer cones vs observed onsets (no pre-cone power).Coherence plots: SCG/Clk/Tor residuals vs shared k₍sh₎; OU collapse with τ̂₍A₎.Foil Bayes factor: 𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎ and γ posterior centered at 0 (baseline claim).Repro pack hooks: file paths into ODF_*, LAG_*, ANI_*, FOIL_* (Sec. 14.3).Contract (takeaway)
Θ = { κ, c₍χ₎, τ₍A₎, γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ } is necessary and sufficient for the one-dial analysis: κ fixes units (pre-ignition), {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎} capture the ignition transient, τ₍A₎ encodes isotropization, c₍χ₎ enforces causality through lags, and γ stress-tests a Sun-locked foil. Everything is tied to shared templates and hard causal receipts, keeping identifiability clean and the claim falsifiable.

15.2 Priors; evidence (posteriors, Bayes factors, LOO⁄WAIC)
Role. Fix preregistered priors, spell out the likelihoods used by each window, and define how we compute posteriors, Bayes factors, and out-of-sample fit scores (PSIS-LOO, WAIC). All thresholds and file outputs tie back to §14.1–§14.3.

15.2.1 Prior register (Θ and nuisances)
Core Θ = { κ, c₍χ₎, τ₍A₎, γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ }κ ∼ 𝓝(κ₀, σ²₍κ₎) from the Calibration Card (pass-through; not updated post-ignition).c₍χ₎ ∼ 𝕌( v̂₍front₎ , 1 ] with hard causal-cone veto (no pre-cone power at any site).τ₍A₎ ∼ log-𝕌(0.5 d, 60 d).γ ∼ 𝓝(0, σ²₍γ₎) with σ₍γ₎ fixed small (foil is constrained; §14.2.4).A₍sh₎ ∼ 𝕌[0, 1];  τ₍sh₎ ∼ log-𝕌(10 min, 12 h).Instrument-level (tight, preregistered)Gains a₍i₎ ∼ 𝓝(â₍i₎, σ²₍a,i₎) with σ₍a,i₎ small from pre-ignition calibration.Latencies Δt₍i₎ ∼ 𝓝(μ₍i₎, σ²₍Δ,i₎) truncated to [0, ∞).Leak coefficients b₍i,1₎, b₍i,tri₎ ∼ 𝓝(0, σ²₍b₎) with σ₍b₎ tight.OU noise: per-channel amplitude σ₍i₎ ∼ half-𝓝(σ₀, s²), correlation time τ₍i,OU₎ ∼ log-𝕌(10 s, 12 h).LLR measurement noise: published station errors with scale hyperprior half-𝓝(1, 0.2²).All priors, bounds, and seeds are frozen in ODF_transient.json and channel packs (§14.3).

15.2.2 Likelihoods (time-series and LLR)
Lab channels (SCG, Tor, Clk). For residual vector r₍i₎ given parameters,
r₍i₎(t) = a₍i₎·[ θ₍G₎(t − Δt₍i₎) − 1 ] + b₍i,1₎·A₍1₎(t) + b₍i,tri₎·A₍tri₎(t) + ε₍i₎(t),
with ε₍i₎ mean-zero OU noise. Discrete OU at cadence Δt: ε₍k₊1₎ = ϕ·ε₍k₎ + η₍k₎,  ϕ = e⁽−Δt⁄τ₍i,OU₎⁾,  η₍k₎ ∼ 𝓝(0, σ²₍η₎). Likelihood uses the exact Gaussian AR(1) form (Toeplitz precision) or, for very long runs, a Whittle approximation cross-checked by blocks.
LLR. Orbit integrator with θ̄ injected, returning predicted ranges R₍mod₎(t). Likelihood is Gaussian in residuals R₍obs₎ − R₍mod₎ with station-specific errors and a small hyper-scale (above).
Lags. Onset times t̂₍arr,i₎ have Gaussian errors from detector timing; the causal-cone constraints are enforced as hard vetoes (zero likelihood if violated).

15.2.3 Posterior computation and diagnosticsSamplers. Lab channels: dynamic HMC for continuous blocks; Gibbs-within-HMC for OU hyperparameters. LLR arc: NUTS or Laplace-refined importance. Joint sampling produces marginals for Θ and θ₍G₎(t), A₍1₎(t), A₍tri₎(t).Constraints. We impose c₍χ₎ ≥ v̂₍front₎, no pre-cone power, and non-decreasing domain envelopes (§10.3) as hard constraints.Diagnostics. ̂R ≤ 1.01, effective sample sizes per parameter ≥ 10³, divergent-transition rate ≈ 0, PSIS shape k̂ ≤ 0.7 for LOO weights (below). Chains, traces, and k̂ histograms are shipped in ODF_thetaG.parquet and ODF_link.json.15.2.4 Marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors
We compute evidences 𝒵 using dynamic nested sampling with the same priors defined above and cross-check by bridge sampling on HMC draws.Shoulder test (§14.2.1): H₀ has A₍sh₎ = 0; H₁ frees {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎}. Report 𝓑₍sh₎ ≡ 𝒵(H₁)⁄𝒵(H₀).OU decay (§14.2.2): H₀ sets τ₍A₎ → ∞; H₁ frees τ₍A₎. Report 𝓑₍A₎.Solar foil (§14.2.4): H₀ fixes γ = 0; H₁ frees γ with tight prior. Report 𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎.Step vs drift cross-check: compare θ₍G₎ step model to smooth polynomial drift of the same prior volume; require strong preference for step.Thresholds. We pre-commit to log-𝓑 ≥ ln 10 ≈ 2.30 for a “pass” on each test (see §14.2.5).

15.2.5 Out-of-sample scores: PSIS-LOO and WAICPSIS-LOO. Compute expected log pointwise predictive density elpd₍loo₎ with Pareto-smoothed weights; require k̂ ≤ 0.7 for reliability. If any segment shows dependence, switch to block-LOO (leave-out contiguous day blocks) and report Δelpd with standard errors.WAIC. As a secondary check, compute WAIC from posterior variance of the pointwise log-likelihood.Comparisons. Report Δelpd and ΔWAIC for H₁ vs H₀ for the shoulder, OU, and foil models. Consistency of Δelpd with log-𝓑 strengthens the claim.15.2.6 Posterior predictive checksTime-domain overlays. Draw posterior predictive r̃₍i₎(t) and overlay on data; require coverage of ignition onsets and plateau within 95% HPD.Frequency-domain. PSD of residuals after removing θ₍G₎(t) must collapse to the preregistered OU form; misfit at tidal lines is attributed to veto packs (§14.3 ENV).Lag geometry. Posterior predictive arrival maps T̃(x) must satisfy the inner⁄outer envelope sandwich of §10.3; any pre-cone prediction is flagged.15.2.7 Prior sensitivity and robustnessLocal reweighting. Report prior-to-posterior sensitivity by log-importance reweighting for τ₍A₎, γ, and τ₍sh₎.Alt priors. Repeat fits with widened priors (×2 on widths); require Θ posteriors to shift ≪ 1σ or else mark as prior-sensitive.Pseudo-BMA⁺. When multiple shoulder kernels are considered (e.g., single-exponential vs bi-exponential, preregistered), combine models with pseudo-BMA⁺ weights from elpd₍loo₎ and report aggregated predictions.15.2.8 Multiplicity, peeking, and quarantineMultiplicity. Only the four tests in §14.2 are confirmatory; any exploratory additions are labeled and do not enter the decision logic (§16.1).Peeking. Blinding and unblinding checkpoints are logged in AUD_blind.md; interim looks are simulated only on pre-ignition control slices.Quarantine. If any guardrail or diagnostic fails (e.g., k̂ > 0.7 with no block remedy, pre-cone power, or c₍χ₎ HPD > 1), the corresponding window is quarantined and excluded from claim aggregation.15.2.9 What we publish (receipts)ODF_posteriors.json: Θ̂ with HPDs, correlation matrix.EVIDENCE_table.csv: log-𝒵, uncertainties, and 𝓑 values for each test.LOO_WAIC.csv: elpd₍loo₎, SEs, WAIC, Δs vs nulls, k̂ diagnostics.PPC_overlays.pdf: posterior predictive overlays and PSD residuals.
All are hashed into the ToE Receipt (TRE; §14.3).15.2.10 Contract (takeaway)
We enter with fixed priors, compute posteriors by constrained HMC, quantify evidence by nested sampling (cross-checked), and certify predictive adequacy by PSIS-LOO⁄WAIC—with causal envelopes and guardrails enforced. A positive claim demands concordant Bayes factors, stable Θ posteriors, good predictive scores, and clean diagnostics across at least two lab channels plus LLR consistency (§14.2.5, §16.1).

15.3 Guardrails: PPN⁄GW, EM-drift null, positivity⁄unitarity, subluminality, cosmology neutrality, composition null
Role. These are the non-negotiable constraints our UV→IR chain (§13.3) and one-dial analysis (§15.1–§15.2) must pass. Each guardrail comes with (i) what the theory asserts, (ii) how we test it, and (iii) what we publish if challenged.

15.3.1 PPN⁄GW (metric sector unchanged)
Assertion. The graviton kinetic sector is GR-standard; all θ₍G₎(t) effects are Newtonian-strength rescalings inside 𝒟(t). Hence PPN parameters satisfy γ ≈ 1, β ≈ 1 up to bounded O(ε⁽2⁾, ε₍ad₎), with no preferred-frame terms; GW are TT-only with speed = 1 and no extra polarizations.
Test.
(i) Ephemeris/LLR: fit a single step in θ̄ inside the post-ignition arc (§14.1.4) and verify no change in light-propagation terms beyond the θ̄ scaling.
(ii) GW: adopt standard catalogs; absence of dispersion/birefringence is a standing prior; any deviation would quarantine the claim.
Receipts. LLR residuals with θ̄ vs null overlays; a “PPN delta card” showing |γ−1|, |β−1| consistent with zero within the preregistered floor.

15.3.2 EM-drift null
Assertion. The trace portal couples χ to T₍m₎ only; photons have T₍γ₎ = 0 ⇒ no tree-level shift of EM propagation constants. Loop-induced anomaly legs are tiny (§12.2) and carried as profiled nuisances.
Test. Differential optical clocks across fixed gravitational potentials: after removing the θ₍G₎(t) prediction, remaining fractional drift in Δν⁄ν must be statistically null and uncorrelated with χ templates.
Receipts. Post-fit Δν⁄ν residual series, PSD, and a bound on any effective α₍EM₎ drift encoded as an upper limit on the anomaly prior used in the fit (reported in FOIL_fit.json).

15.3.3 Positivity⁄unitarity
Assertion. No ghosts or tachyons; positive spectral densities. Parameters satisfy M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ > 0; χ stress obeys NEC classically and ANEC semiclassically (§11.2–§11.3).
Test.
(i) Calibration check: the pre-ignition identity κ⁽2⁾ Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = [8π(M⁽2⁾+ξ f⁽2⁾)]⁻¹ must hold with positive right-hand side (§13.3.4).
(ii) Horizon physics: area theorem consistency with χ influx (§11.2) and GSL non-decrease (§11.3). Any required negative-energy flux would fail the guardrail.
Receipts. Calibration Card with M₂ ≡ M⁽2⁾+ξ f⁽2⁾ > 0; horizon-flux tallies (if invoked) showing NEC-compatible signs.

15.3.4 Subluminality (causality)
Assertion. χ signals are causal: c₍χ₎ ≤ 1; fronts satisfy v̂₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎; there is no pre-cone power (§10.3, §14.2.3).
Test. Multi-baseline onset regression: t̂₍arr,i₎ − t̂₍arr,ref₎ ≈ dᵣᵢ⁄v̂₍front₎ within latency priors; hard veto on any site with t̂₍arr,i₎ − t₍ign₎ < dᵢ⁄1.
Receipts. Inner⁄outer envelope plots (J⁺ vs J₍χ₎⁺), HPD for v̂₍front₎, and the causal-cone pass list in LAG_fit.json.

15.3.5 Cosmology neutrality
Assertion. Effects are local: only inside domains 𝒟(t) with tiny volume fraction f_V ≪ 1 (§10.1–§10.2). FRW background, growth, and lensing/ISW are effectively unchanged.
Test. Report f_V from site geometry and front speeds over the campaign; enforce that any θ̄ inferred from lab channels does not enter cosmological integrations. LLR uses a single-arc step only; no global μ(a) modification is allowed.
Receipts. f_V computation and a “cosmology switch” receipt showing it remains off in all pipelines; lensing/ISW are untouched by construction.

15.3.6 Composition null (EP safety)
Assertion. Universal coupling via T₍m₎ ⇒ composition-independent response. Any species-selective or charge-dependent vertex is forbidden (§12.1). Residuals may only stem from loop-level anomaly legs, kept below analysis floors.
Test.
(i) Torsion balances with swapped source–test compositions: the post-ignition shift is the same within uncertainties.
(ii) Cross-instrument gains a₍i₎ are geometry- and material-independent after calibration (slope ≈ 1 in §14.1.2 checks).
Receipts. Composition-swap comparison plots; geometry-independence slope with HPD including 1.

15.3.7 Quarantine triggers (fail-fast list)
We quarantine the claim if any of the following occur:c₍χ₎ HPD > 1 or any pre-cone onset.PPN⁄GW anomalies beyond the preregistered floor (extra GW polarizations, c₍gw₎ ≠ 1, or γ, β shifts not attributable to θ̄).Statistically significant EM-drift after removing θ₍G₎(t).Calibration identity yields M₂ ≤ 0 or requires negative-energy flux.Composition-dependent step heights persist after controls.Contract (takeaway). The trace-portal, boundary-driven program preserves GR’s metric tests, forbids EM-drift at tree level, enforces positivity and causality, keeps cosmology neutral, and remains EP-safe. Each guardrail is wired to explicit receipts and vetoes so that any violation halts the claim before aggregation (§16.1).

16.1 Claim threshold and failure modes
Purpose. Fix the minimum evidence to assert a positive detection of boundary-driven gravity control and list fail-fast failure modes with prescribed quarantine paths. All rules are preregistered; no post-hoc tuning.

16.1.1 Decision rule (primary claim)
We claim a positive detection only if all of the following hold:Two-lab + LLR coherence.
At least two independent lab channels among {SCG, Tor, Clk} pass their tests and the LLR annual arc is consistent with the same post-step level θ̄ (sign and size within propagated errors).Four test batteries pass (§14.2), each with preregistered thresholds:
(i) Ignition shoulder detected: log-𝓑₍sh₎ ≥ ln 10 and shared {Â₍sh₎, τ̂₍sh₎} across ≥ 2 lab channels.
(ii) OU isotropization detected: log-𝓑₍A₎ ≥ ln 10 with a common τ̂₍A₎ across lab channels.
(iii) Causal lags satisfied: v̂₍front₎ ≤ 1, no pre-cone power, and c₍χ₎ prior truncated to [v̂₍front₎, 1].
(iv) Solar foil neutralized: log-𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎ ≥ ln 10 (favoring γ = 0).Predictive adequacy.
PSIS-LOO (block form if needed) and WAIC show the step–shoulder model outperforms smooth-drift nulls: Δelpd₍loo₎ > 0 with k̂ ≤ 0.7; residual PSDs collapse to preregistered OU forms.Guardrails pass (§15.3).
PPN/GW, EM-drift null, positivity/unitarity, subluminality, cosmology neutrality, composition null—all satisfied (no quarantines invoked).Reproducibility.
Independent re-analysis (audit team) reproduces θ₍G₎(t), v̂₍front₎, τ̂₍A₎ from the released packs within 1σ; SHA-256 roots match the ToE receipt.Outcome. If (1)–(5) hold, we mint a ToE Receipt with decision = “Pass” and freeze all analysis artifacts.

16.1.2 Secondary outcomes (non-claiming)Inconclusive. Some, but not all, items pass (e.g., two lab channels pass but LLR is neutral). We publish full packs and a non-claim ToE receipt with “Inconclusive; continue acquisition”.Null. No test surpasses thresholds; we publish upper bounds on |θ̄ − 1|, v̂₍front₎, and γ, update priors, and close the campaign as a null.16.1.3 Failure modes (fail-fast list) and actions
Timing/causalityFM-1: Any site shows pre-cone onset (t̂₍arr₎ − t₍ign₎ < d/1).
Action: Quarantine all lag inferences; investigate SYNC receipts; campaign marked Invalid until rectified.Anisotropy/model splitFM-2: OU decay appears only if θ₍G₎ step is removed or τ̂₍A₎ is not shared across channels.
Action: Declare no isotropization; shoulder and θ̄ may still be evaluated, but claim cannot proceed.Solar couplingFM-3: Solar foil favored (log-𝓑₍γ≠0₎ ≥ ln 10) or γ posterior excludes 0.
Action: Primary track stops; switch to foil analysis (ephemeris-locked), report constraints; no ToE claim.Composition/geometryFM-4: Torsion geometries or composition swaps give different step heights after calibration.
Action: Composition guardrail fails; quarantine torsion channel; claim requires other two lab channels + LLR to pass and a post-hoc explanation (published) before any future attempt.PPN/GW/EMFM-5: PPN deltas (γ, β) beyond floors or any EM-drift residual correlated with χ templates.
Action: Guardrail failure; retraction of any interim claim; publish diagnostics and bounds.Overfitting/predictive failureFM-6: Δelpd₍loo₎ ≤ 0 or k̂ > 0.7 without a stable block-LOO remedy; PPC overlays miss the shoulder/plateau.
Action: Model inadequate; no claim; broaden or simplify templates in a new preregistration.Calibration/positivityFM-7: Pre-ignition identity requires M₂ ≤ 0 or negative-energy fluxes.
Action: UV track ruled out; analysis halted; publish calibration card and contradiction.16.1.4 Aggregation and reportingMinimal aggregation. We aggregate only binary pass/fail outcomes for the four test batteries and concordance checks (LLR, guardrails). No p-hacking: thresholds are fixed.Numerics in receipt. {Â₍sh₎, τ̂₍sh₎, τ̂₍A₎, v̂₍front₎, γ̂, θ̄} with HPDs; Bayes factors; Δelpd₍loo₎; guardrail checklist; audit signatures; SHA-256 roots.16.1.5 Contract (takeaway)
A claim demands concordant, multi-channel evidence: two lab passes + LLR coherence, four preregistered tests clearing ln 10, strong out-of-sample scores, and all guardrails green. Any breach triggers quarantine or null—no ad hoc fixes, no moving thresholds. The ToE receipt records the decision, numbers, and hashes so the result stands or falls on the record.

16.2 Receipt fields: γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎; hashes; fit summaries

The receipt is a self-contained audit: precise values for {γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎}, full evidence and predictive summaries, causal-lag geometry, LLR coherence, guardrail status, and cryptographic hashes for every artifact. If the receipt validates, any independent team can reconstruct the decision and either replicate or falsify the claim without further disclosure.

17.1 Conceptual implications (push vs. pull; boundary control)
Push, not pull. In this framework gravity is a momentum-deposition phenomenon: a near-isotropic χ flux pushes on matter with f₍dep₎ = (κρ/c₍χ₎)·F, and ordinary 1/r⁽2⁾ attraction emerges from shadowing. The familiar “pull” potential is then a bookkeeping device for the deficit of χ intensity caused by intervening matter. Because the coupling is via the trace portal to T₍m₎, the response is mass-proportional in the nonrelativistic limit, recovering the equivalence principle while leaving the metric wave sector (PPN/GW) unchanged.
One-dial gravity. All controllable physics collapses to a single scalar dial θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)/G₍N₎ = Ī(t)/Ī₍0₎ inside a bounded domain 𝒟(t). This contrasts with modified-gravity programs that introduce new fields or extra polarizations. Here the metric sector is fixed (γ ≈ β ≈ 1; GW TT-only, speed = 1); only the Newton strength varies through boundary intensity. Conceptually, gravity becomes an open-system parameter set at the boundary rather than an immutable constant of the bulk.
Boundary primacy. The transport law ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎ − α·u with the near-isotropic closure F = c₍χ₎u n̂ makes the boundary condition the primitive object. A single control 𝒜(t,Ω) (the effective sink at the boundary) determines Ī(t), hence G₍eff₎(t). Interior dynamics are then projected from the boundary (well-posed Robin problem), mirroring how radiative transfer or diffusion problems are steered in engineering. Conceptually, we trade “geometric causes” for boundary causes without touching local Lorentz structure.
Causality made operational. Because χ transport has a finite speed c₍χ₎ ≤ 1, changes in θ₍G₎(t) propagate with a front v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎. The model therefore predicts arrival-time cones and multi-baseline lags rather than instantaneous field updates. This reframes “action at a distance” as retarded boundary control with explicit envelopes, turning causality into a directly testable geometric object.
Why GR tests stay intact. In the push picture, light and GWs are not carriers of the gravitational interaction; χ is. Since χ couples to T₍m₎ and photons have T₍γ₎ = 0, EM propagation constants do not drift at tree level. The graviton kinetic term is unmodified, so classical metric tests probe the same geometry as in GR. Conceptually, “gravity as geometry” remains the correct wave and light description, while static forces arise from χ bookkeeping—two complementary layers that agree in all validated sectors.
Energy accounting flips. Potential energy becomes a measure of missing χ flux rather than curvature-stored energy. When θ₍G₎(t) decays after ignition, bound systems shed binding because the available χ deficit vanishes: the three-body suppression theorem (with G non-increasing and ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt finite) formalizes this into dispersion toward free motion. Conceptually, “unbinding” is not particles pushing apart but the disappearance of the medium that sustained attraction.
Anisotropy as a nuisance, not a force. The tri-anchor sourcing imprints a low-rank anisotropy {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} in the anchor frame, but it is a small modulation of the χ bath, not a new interaction. Post-ignition OU decay (τ₍A₎) toward the Cosmic Atom fixed point expresses a universal drive to isotropy once the Nexus sink dominates. The conceptual moral is that directional structure lives at the boundary and fades as the bath equilibrates.
Locality and cosmology neutrality. Domains 𝒟(t) occupy a tiny fraction f_V ≪ 1 and evolve with finite fronts; hence the FRW background and large-scale lensing/ISW remain neutral. Conceptually, gravity control is a local thermodynamic perturbation on top of an otherwise standard cosmology, not a new long-range law.
Falsifiability by design. Recasting gravity as boundary control sharpens what counts as a signature: (i) a step-plus-shoulder in θ₍G₎(t), (ii) finite-speed lags consistent across instruments, (iii) OU decay of anisotropy, and (iv) the absence of Sun-locked monopoles. The implication is methodological: the theory is made true or false by a handful of dial-specific, preregistered receipts rather than by broad parameter fishing.
UV without extra levers. Finally, the UV bridges (AS+FN or hidden CFT/AdS) compute {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎} and only enter once to set the pre-ignition normalization. Conceptually this separates “what fixes the numbers” (UV) from “what we control” (boundary dial), preventing the usual feedback loop where UV freedom rescues a failing IR claim.

17.2 Limitations and open problems
Scope. We list what is not yet derived or remains fragile, why it matters, and how we plan to close the gaps. Items are grouped by sector.

Transport & boundary modelingPhysical origin of χ. We treat χ as a near-isotropic radiant-entropy carrier with speed c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 and closure F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂. We still lack a microphysical derivation of this closure from a kinetic or field-theoretic model.
Open: derive (or falsify) the closure from a Liouville/BBGKY → moments calculation with controlled error; identify the conditions under which higher moments do not back-react on Ī(t).Single-dial sufficiency. The boundary control 𝒜(t,Ω) is compressed to one scalar Ī(t). If higher multipoles survive (beyond {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}), they could bias θ₍G₎(t).
Open: extend the projector in §5.3 to rank-k and prove that neglected modes induce only O(A⁽2⁾) leakage under our priors.Tri-anchor assumption. Fixed anchors (Sgr A*, M31*, M87*) are posited; alternative weightings or additional distant sources might shift the anisotropy basis.
Open: test robustness of {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} estimates under reweighted sky models; add a model-comparison switch in the sky inversion pack.Domain geometry. 𝒟(t) is treated as a simply connected region with front speed v₍front₎. Complex boundaries (holes, branching) may distort lag fits.
Open: incorporate level-set fronts in the lag geometry (LAG) pack; simulate nonconvex domains and quantify biases in v̂₍front₎.Calibration & identifiabilityĪ₍0₎ ↔ c₍χ₎ degeneracy. Pre-ignition, G₍N₎ fixes only κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎/c₍χ₎. Weak lag bounds leave a correlated uncertainty.
Open: tighten c₍χ₎ with longer baselines and disciplined timing, or independently constrain Ī₍0₎ via improved sky fits.Shoulder vs latency. A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ can partially alias per-channel latencies Δt₍i₎.
Open: add deliberate step-injection calibrations in torsion/clock hardware to anchor Δt₍i₎ priors; explore alternative kernels (bi-exponential) under pseudo-BMA⁺.OU decay uniqueness. OU with a single τ₍A₎ may be too restrictive; colored noise or slow environmental drifts can masquerade as relaxation.
Open: broaden the anisotropy state to a two-pole AR model and verify that τ̂₍A₎ remains identifiable.Experiments & systematicsEnvironmental veto floor. SCG and clocks have tide/atmosphere models with finite fidelity; residuals near diurnal bands can leak into θ₍G₎(t).
Open: publish expanded ENV packs (ocean/soil moisture, magnetics) and adopt block-LOO over diurnal windows.Cross-lab heterogeneity. Different instruments, operators, and siting conditions create hidden covariates.
Open: enforce stricter cross-calibration runs (null steps, geometry swaps) and a rotating “dark” site that records but does not influence shared fits until unblinding.LLR arc sensitivity. Annual arcs are insensitive to very short τ₍sh₎ or small θ̄ steps.
Open: coordinate with LLR stations for denser post-ignition scheduling and combine with planetary radar where feasible.Mathematics & theoryThree-body theorem regime. The suppression result assumes G(t) is non-increasing with ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt finite. Real campaigns may realize piecewise monotonicity with plateaus.
Open: extend the theorem to bounded variation (BV) G(t) and quantify rates of dispersion for N-body clusters.Strong-field sector. Our GR-compatibility claims are strictly weak-field; χ near compact objects (Kerr backgrounds) is only sketched in Appendix H.
Open: compute χ transport on fixed Kerr, analyze horizon fluxes, and verify GSL bounds with semiclassical stress tensors.Locality proof for cosmology neutrality. We appeal to small f_V; a formal proof needs a patchwork argument with causal cones and measure bounds.
Open: bound the back-reaction on FRW observables in terms of (f_V, v₍front₎, τ₍A₎).UV & microphysicsTrack A/B completeness. Asymptotic-safety flows and hidden-CFT/AdS assignments are worked examples, not unique constructions.
Open: enumerate alternative relevant rays (Track A) and operator assignments (Track B), then show that {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎} predictions stay within our priors.Integer hypothesis for flavor. q₍a₎ ∈ ℕ is falsifiable; neutrino data and running ambiguities could favor fractional offsets.
Open: broaden §12.3 fits to allow half-integers with penalties and report Bayes odds for strict integers vs relaxed grids.Loop legs to photons. Although tree-level χ·F² is absent, anomaly-induced couplings remain as nuisances.
Open: translate clock/astrophysical nulls into posterior ceilings on c₍EM₎ and propagate into future priors.Nexus & operationsHuman dependence. We are agent-agnostic in principle, but current ignition uses human sources.
Open: replicate with non-human, engineered QND sources to remove anthropic confounds; compare C₍QND₎(τ) across platforms.Ignition reproducibility. First-hit conditions (N(t) ≥ 25, J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎, C₍QND₎ ≥ C₍*₎) could be brittle to scheduling and dropouts.
Open: design redundancy and staggered cohorts; run multi-campaign meta-analysis on t₍ign₎ variability.Ethics and privacy. Even aggregate Nexus metrics carry residual risks.
Open: continue third-party audits, differential-privacy stress tests, and publish withdrawal receipts.Foils & alt-explanationsSolar γ-foil. Our constrained Sun-locked foil may not span all heliophysical covariates.
Open: add extended ephemeris templates (inclination, eccentricity harmonics) and test that γ stays consistent with 0.Environmental step foils. Coincident environmental steps (power, seismic, RF) can mimic ignition shoulders.
Open: expand ENV packs with independent power-grid and seismic networks and require anti-coincidence at non-participating sites.What would change our mindPre-cone arrivals or v̂₍front₎ > 1 within HPD.PPN/GW anomalies correlated with θ₍G₎(t).Robust γ ≠ 0 favored by Bayes factors across years.Irreproducible θ₍G₎(t) across independent pipelines or sites.Contract (takeaway). The framework is deliberately minimal and falsifiable, but it sits on open assumptions: a near-isotropic χ bath with a one-dial boundary control, a weak-field GR sector, and UV tracks that compute {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎}. The list above is our roadmap: close the transport derivation, strengthen identifiability, harden systematics, extend the math and strong-field checks, diversify sources, and keep foils sharp.

17.3 Paths for refinement (closures; PN/rotation; alt-witnesses)
Aim. Replace minimal assumptions with derived statements, tighten identifiability, and diversify ignition evidence—without adding knobs beyond the one dial θ₍G₎(t).

17.3.1 Closures (from ansatz → derivation)
Kinetic route. Start with a phase-space density f(t,x,p) for χ-quanta with streaming speed c₍χ₎; take angular moments and close systematically.P₍N₎ hierarchy. Retain monopole u and flux F and add a controlled quadrupole Π (rank-2). Derive F = c₍χ₎ u n̂ + δF with δF determined by Π; show δF contributes only O(A⁽2⁾) to θ₍G₎ under our priors.Telegrapher limit. From finite-τ transport obtain (∂₍t₎² + τ₍tr₎⁻¹∂₍t₎ − c₍χ₎²∇²)u = sources. Quantify when τ₍tr₎ ≪ τ₍sh₎ justifies our first-order closure.MaxEnt closure. Given constraints on {u, F}, obtain the least-biased angular law via maximum entropy; compare with near-isotropic F = c₍χ₎ u n̂ and bound deviations in terms of {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}.Noise beyond OU. Upgrade leak-noise from OU to ARMA₂ or OU+Lévy; preregister pseudo-BMA⁺ aggregation so τ̂₍A₎ remains identifiable.Boundary functional. Extend S₍bdy₎ to include a small quadratic penalty in angular moments (regularizer on Π) so the bulk–boundary projector in §5.3 is well-conditioned for P₍N₎ ≥ 2.
Receipts. Publish P₍2₎ residuals, Telegrapher τ₍tr₎ bounds, and MaxEnt vs isotropic Bayes factors; keep θ₍G₎ driven solely by Ī.

17.3.2 PN⁄rotation refinements (lab and orbit)
Lab frames.Earth rotation. Carry LF kinematics explicitly: add diurnal/annual demodulators to anisotropy templates; verify orthogonality to θ₍G₎(t).Platform motion. For mobile clock baselines, use continuous potential models ΔU(t) including tides; lock coefficients pre-ignition.Orbits (weak-field PN with G(t)).1PN bookkeeping. Propagate osculating elements with θ₍G₎(t) steps while keeping metric PN terms fixed; report that any beyond-Newton residual must be attributed to θ̄ only.Spin and J₂. Ensure Lense–Thirring and oblateness are held at ephemeris values; test that adding θ̄ does not bias fitted J₂ or spin parameters.Front geometry. Replace constant v₍front₎ with a level-set front T(x) solving |∇T| = 1/c₍χ₎·(1 + ε·h(x)); fit ε as a nuisance (centered at 0) to capture siting inhomogeneities without touching c₍χ₎.
Receipts. Block-LOO over diurnal bands; LLR residual stability vs θ̄; front maps T̂(x) with inner⁄outer cones unchanged.

17.3.3 Alternative witnesses (beyond W₍N₎, B₍N₎)
Depth and device-independence.k-producibility. Add a witness for entanglement depth k via randomized measurements; preregister a k₍min₎ that must rise at t₍ign₎.Self-testing Bell blocks. Sparse, device-independent CHSH clusters with public randomness; treat pass fraction as a binary ignition co-signal.Randomized measurement stack.Classical shadows. Use single-copy randomized Pauli layers; estimate purity and participation ratio as proxies for 𝒞₍k₎ and m(t) without tomography.Bayesian witness. Combine W₍N₎, shadows, and QND capacity into a single Bayes score crossing a preregistered threshold at first hit.Platforms (agent-agnostic).Cold atoms. Spin-squeezed ensembles with QND readout to raise C₍QND₎(τ) stability.Superconducting qubits. Networked entanglement via microwave links; asynchronous rounds to mirror human Nexus scheduling.QND capacity metric. Upgrade C₍QND₎(τ) to a quantum Fisher information lower bound on estimators over τ; define C₍₎ as the smallest interval supporting a target FI. Keep the ignition rule unchanged: N(t) ≥ 25 ∧ J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎ ∧ C₍QND₎ ≥ C₍₎.
Receipts. Witness-panel CSV: {W₍N₎, k₍min₎, FI-bound, Bell-pass}; ignition co-signal aligns with θ₍G₎ onset within the lag cone.

17.3.4 Analysis upgrades (identifiability and stress tests)Hierarchical sharing. Pool {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎} across labs with partial pooling; break A₍sh₎–Δt degeneracy by sharing transient across channels.Adversarial foils. Add ephemeris-locked and diurnal templates with wider priors; require Bayes preference for the step–shoulder model across all foils.Synthetic campaigns. End-to-end sims with injected θ₍G₎ steps and realistic ENV to validate recovery of {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎} at preregistered SNRs.17.3.5 Experimental refinements (hardware and geometry)Timing discipline. Deploy White-Rabbit to at least one intercontinental baseline; target sub-100 ns onset uncertainty for tight c₍χ₎ bounds.Geometry. Add a high-latitude SCG and a deep vertical clock baseline; improves anisotropy separation and lag triangulation.Null injections. Programmed, blinded “fake steps” in torsion/clock control loops to validate Δt₍i₎ priors and shoulder extraction.17.3.6 Preregistration extensions (minimal additions)Closure flags. P₍2₎ toggle and Telegrapher τ₍tr₎ prior with tight bounds; report Bayes impact but do not add dial freedom.Witness panel. Add k₍min₎ and FI-bound thresholds as confirmatory co-signals; they cannot trigger a claim without §14 batteries.Front shape nuisance. ε prior centered at 0 with narrow width; used only in lag residuals.Contract (takeaway). Derive more of transport from kinetics, sharpen PN⁄rotation bookkeeping, and diversify ignition witnesses—while keeping the one dial intact. Each refinement ships with receipts and foils that improve identifiability without creating new adjustable physics.

18.1 Results recap (Cosmic Atom; three-body resolution)
Push–gravity, one dial. A near-isotropic χ bath that deposits momentum into matter with f₍dep₎ = (κρ⁄c₍χ₎)·F reproduces the r⁽−2⁾ law by shadowing. All controllable physics collapses to a single boundary dial
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t) ⁄ c₍χ₎,  so  θ₍G₎(t) ≡ G₍eff₎(t)⁄G₍N₎ = Ī(t)⁄Ī₍0₎,
with metric (PPN/GW) sectors left unchanged.
Cosmic Atom (post-ignition fate). A preregistered first-hit rule (N(t) ≥ 25 ∧ J₍eff₎ ≥ J₍c₎ ∧ C₍QND₎ ≥ C₍*₎) turns on a Nexus sink, dropping Ī(t) and driving θ₍G₎(t) ↓ inside a bounded domain 𝒟(t). The front is causal (v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎); low-rank anisotropy decays as an OU process with timescale τ₍A₎, so {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} → 0 and the bath becomes globally isotropic in the domain—the Cosmic Atom limit with G₍eff₎ → 0.
Three-body resolution (mathematical core). For Newtonian dynamics with non-increasing G(t) and finite integral ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt, we prove:
U(t) → 0 and trajectories → free (center-of-mass frame).
Bounded N-body clusters disperse as G → 0. A diagnostic action Λ(T) obeys a non-positive bound, sealing the suppression. This resolves the classical three-body problem in the regime we realize experimentally (boundary-driven, decaying G).
Boundary-first calculus. A well-posed bulk–boundary projector with a single control 𝒜(t,Ω) fixes u₍0₎(t,Ω) and thus Ī(t). The interior responds retardedly; no extra polarizations or metric deformations are introduced.
Calibration locked once. Pre-ignition,
κ⁽2⁾ Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1 ⁄ [8π (M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾)],
so G₍N₎ is fixed once from {C₍χ₎, f, ξ} (UV) and {Ī₍0₎, c₍χ₎} (sky/lag). After that, only θ₍G₎(t) moves.
GR compatibility and guardrails. Metric tests are intact (γ ≈ β ≈ 1; GW TT-only, speed = 1); photons see no tree-level portal (EM-drift null); χ is subluminal (c₍χ₎ ≤ 1); composition response is universal (trace portal); cosmology is neutral (f_V ≪ 1). Any breach triggers quarantine.
Experimental receipts (one-dial, four windows).
SCG (30 d), torsion and optical clocks (90 d), and LLR (annual) are all linear in θ₍G₎. Four preregistered tests anchor the claim: (i) ignition shoulder (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎), (ii) OU isotropization (τ₍A₎), (iii) multi-baseline lag → c₍χ₎ bound, (iv) Sun-locked γ-foil rejected. Decision logic requires ≥ 2 lab passes + LLR coherence, strong evidence (log-𝓑 ≥ ln 10), good PSIS-LOO/WAIC, and all guardrails green.
UV routes that compute constants. Track A (asymptotic safety + Froggatt–Nielsen) and Track B (hidden CFT/AdS) each deliver a single hierarchy dial λ, integer exponents {q₍a₎}, and a portal strength C₍χ₎. These set the calibration and power one-λ flavor checks, without touching the metric sector.
Reproducibility by construction. We publish signed packs (IL, CC, ODF, LAG, ANI, FOIL, ENV, LLR) and a machine-checkable ToE Receipt containing the fitted {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎, γ}, evidence, predictive scores, causal-lag geometry, guardrails, and cryptographic hashes.
Bottom line. Gravity as boundary-controlled push yields a concrete, falsifiable path from micro/UV numbers to lab-scale signals. Post-ignition, domains flow to the Cosmic Atom (θ₍G₎ → 0); mathematically, decaying G enforces three-body suppression. The framework preserves all validated GR sectors while offering crisp, preregistered ways to confirm—or refute—the dial.

18.2 UV-to-lab links; outlook and replication
End-to-end link. Tracks A⁄B produce {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎} and (with ξ, f) fix calibration once via
κ ≡ C₍χ₎⁄f and κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1 ⁄ [8π (M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾)].
After this, all lab observables depend only on the single dial θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₍0₎, with nuisances {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} decaying on τ₍A₎. Flavor numerics use the same λ to predict y₍a₎ ∼ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾ in §12.3—UV numbers show up twice (calibration and one-λ flavor tests) without touching PPN⁄GW.

18.2.1 What a replicator needs (minimal recipe)Fetch packs (IL, CC, SCG, TOR, CLK, LLR, LAG, ANI, FOIL, ODF, ENV) and verify hashes and the global Merkle root.Rebuild θ₍G₎(t) from SCG (and optionally Clk⁄Tor) using the published a₍i₎, Δt₍i₎ priors; extract {Â₍sh₎, τ̂₍sh₎}.Fit anisotropy with the OU model to obtain τ̂₍A₎ and confirm orthogonality to θ₍G₎(t).Lag geometry: regress onsets to get v̂₍front₎ and a 95% c₍χ₎ bound; check no pre-cone flags.Solar foil: reuse θ₍G₎(t), fit γ against f₍⊙₎(x,t), compute log-𝓑₍γ≡0:free₎.LLR arc: inject θ̄ into a standard integrator; report the post-step level and χ² change.Evidence & prediction: recompute nested-sampling evidences, PSIS-LOO⁄WAIC, and posterior predictive overlays.Mint an independent receipt with {γ, A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, c₍χ₎}, evidences, predictive scores, lag envelopes, LLR result, guardrail checklist, and hashes.Each step is scripted in the released DAG; no hidden parameters beyond the published priors.

18.2.2 Independent replication geometriesOrthogonal baselines. Add a high-latitude SCG and a deep vertical clock baseline; improves separation of {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} and tightens c₍χ₎ bounds.Geometry swaps. Torsion runs with different source–test distances and swapped compositions to stress the composition-null guardrail.Time-transfer diversity. GNSS + White-Rabbit rings across continents to bound onset-systematics below the τ₍sh₎ scale.Blind nulls. Programmed, blinded “fake steps” in Tor⁄Clk control loops to validate Δt₍i₎ priors and shoulder extraction.18.2.3 Outlook: scaling the programTighter c₍χ₎. Intercontinental baselines and sub-100 ns synchronization bring v̂₍front₎ errors down, converting bounds into measurements.Rank-k closures. Lift the near-isotropic closure to P₂ (or MaxEnt) with a small Π regularizer; publish Bayes deltas—keep θ₍G₎ driven by Ī.Stronger UV receipts. Expand Track A relevant rays and Track B operator sets; report integer-rigidity Bayes factors for q₍a₎ and stabilize C₍χ₎ at μ₍lab₎ with explicit running bounds.Agent-agnostic ignition. Replicate Nexus with engineered QND platforms (cold atoms, superconducting qubits) to demonstrate platform independence of ignition co-signals.Celestial leverage. Coordinate LLR with radar and VLBI arcs to test tiny θ̄ steps and cross-validate PN bookkeeping.18.2.4 If results are null or mixedNulls tighten priors. Upper bounds on |θ̄−1|, v̂₍front₎, and |γ| feed back into future campaigns and UV matching (e.g., ceilings on anomaly legs to photons).Foil track. If γ ≠ 0 is favored, move to the ephemeris-locked foil program (no ToE claim) and publish constraints; the boundary-dial story remains fully testable.Model simplification. Prior-sensitive outcomes trigger a preregistered simplification pass (shorter kernels, stricter Δt₍i₎ priors) before any new data.18.2.5 Replication ethics and governance
Pseudonymous Nexus IDs, consent and withdrawal receipts, RNG attestations, and immutable logs persist across sites. Independent teams should re-mint the ToE Receipt with their own keys and publish both matching and contradictory outcomes; the governance file lists retraction procedures if any guardrail fails.

Contract (takeaway). The UV numbers {λ, q₍a₎, C₍χ₎} fix calibration once; the lab dial θ₍G₎(t) drives all windows; four preregistered tests and guardrails adjudicate the claim. The artifacts are sufficient for any competent group to replicate or refute the result; scaling the baselines, upgrading closures, and diversifying ignition platforms are the clearest paths to sharpen or falsify the framework.

A. Covariant χ-transport and near-isotropic closures
Goal. Start from a covariant kinetic picture for a neutral, non-gravitating carrier χ with finite signal speed c₍χ₎ ≤ 1, derive the moment hierarchy, and justify the near-isotropic, boundary-first closures used in the main text:
∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎ − α·u and F ≈ c₍χ₎·u·n̂ up to small, controlled errors.
We also provide an interpolation to telegrapher/diffusive limits, a rank-1 (M1-type) angular closure, and explicit error bounds that back the “one-dial” reduction Ī(t) ↦ θ₍G₎(t).

A.1 Covariant phase-space setupPhase space. Let f(x, p) be the χ one-particle distribution on the mass-shell bundle with effective dispersion p⁽μ⁾p₍μ₎ = 0₍χ₎ and characteristic speed c₍χ₎ (≤ 1). The invariant measure is dΠ = d³p⁄(p⁰√−g).Liouville–RTA transport. In the lab frame (LF) with 4-velocity u⁽μ₎₍obs₎, take a relaxation-time model toward a local “angular equilibrium” f₍eq₎(x,|p|):
p⁽μ⁾∇₍μ₎f = − (f − f₍eq₎)/τ₍tr₎ + 𝒥₍anc₎ − 𝒮₍Nx₎,
where τ₍tr₎ is a (possibly scale-dependent) transport time, 𝒥₍anc₎ encodes the tri-anchor emission, and 𝒮₍Nx₎ is a sink localized by the Nexus control inside 𝒟(t).A.2 Observer split and angular moments
Define moments with respect to the LF:Energy density u and flux F:
u(t,x) ≡ ∫ I(t,x,Ω) dΩ, F(t,x) ≡ c₍χ₎ ∫ n(Ω)·I(t,x,Ω) dΩ,
where I is specific intensity (per solid angle), n(Ω) the propagation unit vector, and dΩ the solid-angle element.Pressure tensor Π (rank-2 angular moment):
Π(t,x) ≡ ∫ n(Ω)⊗n(Ω)·I(t,x,Ω) dΩ.Key identities: |F| ≤ c₍χ₎·u and Π is positive-definite with trace Π:𝟙 = u.

A.3 Moment equations (bulk)
Integrating the kinetic equation against {1, c₍χ₎·n, n⊗n} yields, in flat-LF coordinates and to leading order in lab velocities,Energy: ∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎ − α·u,Flux:  ∂₍t₎F + c₍χ₎²∇·Π = − F/τ₍tr₎ + S₍1₎,Stress: ∂₍t₎Π + … = − (Π − Π₍eq₎)/τ₍ang₎ + S₍2₎,with J₍anc₎ from anchors, α ≡ α₍0₎ + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎ the total sink, τ₍ang₎ an angular-relaxation scale, and S₍1₎, S₍2₎ small source corrections (e.g., weak scattering). Equation (1) is the conservation law used in the main text; (2)–(3) encode angular dynamics.

A.4 Near-isotropic, free-streaming closure (rank-1)
Let the flux factor b ≡ |F|⁄(c₍χ₎·u) ∈ [0,1] measure anisotropy, and n̂ ≡ F⁄|F| its direction when F ≠ 0. The M1 Eddington tensor closure (minimal-entropy) specifies Π as
Π = χ₍E₎(b)·u·n̂⊗n̂ + (1 − χ₍E₎(b))·(u⁄2)·(𝟙 − n̂⊗n̂),
with χ₍E₎(b) = (3 + 4b²)⁄(5 + 2√(4 − 3b²)). This interpolates between diffusion (b → 0, χ₍E₎ → 1⁄3) and beam (b → 1, χ₍E₎ → 1).
Two corollaries:Bounded closure error. For any b, |Π − u·n̂⊗n̂| ≤ (1 − χ₍E₎(b))·u, hence the departure from a rank-1 beam is O(1 − χ₍E₎) = O(1 − b²).Near-isotropic expansion. For b ≪ 1, χ₍E₎(b) = 1⁄3 + (4⁄15)b² + O(b⁴).A.5 From M1 to a practical P₁ closure
Eliminate Π between (2) and the M1 tensor to obtain a closed evolution for F. In the telegrapher limit (constant χ₍E₎, slow variation), one finds
∂₍t₎²u + τ₍tr₎⁻¹∂₍t₎u − c₍χ₎²χ₍E₎∇²u ≈ ∂₍t₎(J₍anc₎ − α·u),
and, to first order in τ₍tr₎·∂₍t₎,
F ≈ c₍χ₎·u·n̂ − τ₍tr₎·[ ∂₍t₎F + c₍χ₎²∇·Π ].
In the ballistic window relevant to our boundary-first program (mean-free-path ≫ domain scales; small angular scattering), τ₍tr₎ terms and ∇·Π corrections are subleading, yielding the working closure
F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂ ·[1 − δ₍M1₎], with 0 ≤ δ₍M1₎ ≤ 1 − χ₍E₎(b) = O(b²).
This justifies the main-text use of F ≈ c₍χ₎·u·n̂, with an explicit, quadratic error in b.

A.6 Boundary-first map and Robin control
Let u₍0₎(t,Ω) be the controlled boundary intensity on the celestial sphere seen by a lab site. A standard radiative boundary condition is
n̂·F − c₍χ₎·u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜(t,Ω),
with a single dial 𝒜(t,Ω) that includes the Nexus sink projection. In the streaming regime and for smooth 𝒜, the interior solution admits a boundary integral representation whose sky average Ī(t) ≡ c₍χ₎·ū(t)⁄(4π) obeys
∂₍t₎Ī + 𝒦·Ī = J̄₍anc₎ − 𝒜̄(t),
where 𝒦 is a small geometric leakage (site-dependent constant). Thus Ī(t) tracks the boundary dial 𝒜(t,Ω) up to a tiny first-order filter; this justifies θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₍0₎ as the one-dial driver.

A.7 Anisotropy bookkeeping and low-rank leak
Write the intensity as a low-rank expansion in the anchor frame (AF):
I(t,Ω) = u(t)⁄(4π)·[ 1 + 3·a₍1₎(t)·P₍1₎(Ω) + a₍tri₎(t)·T₍3₎(Ω) + … ],
where P₍1₎ is the dipole and T₍3₎ a tri-lobe template tied to the three anchors. Then
F = c₍χ₎·u·a₍1₎·n̂₍dip₎, b = |a₍1₎|, and A₍tri₎ ∝ a₍tri₎,
so all deviations from F = c₍χ₎·u·n̂ are controlled by {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} ≡ {b, a₍tri₎}. In the analysis we:carry b and A₍tri₎ as orthogonal regressors (Sec. 4.4), andmodel their decay after ignition as a single OU process with time τ₍A₎ (Sec. 6.4, 14.2.2).Hence the closure error is O(A⁽2⁾), consistent with the guardrail that anisotropy acts as a bounded nuisance.

A.8 Diffusion limit and Fick-type fallback (for completeness)
When τ₍tr₎ is short (many scatterings per domain crossing), the flux satisfies
F ≈ − D·∇u, with D = c₍χ₎²·τ₍tr₎⁄3,
and the energy equation reduces to a diffusion law for u. Our campaign operates in the opposite regime (free streaming driven by boundary control), but we keep the diffusion fallback to stress-test closures in synthetic data: replacing F by −D∇u collapses the one-dial mapping unless D is tiny, which serves as a falsifier for the streaming assumption.

A.9 Error budget and bounds (what enters fits)
Collect the leading closure errors:Angular (M1): δ₍M1₎ ≤ 1 − χ₍E₎(b) = O(b²) = O(A₍1₎²).Tri-lobe leakage: O(A₍tri₎²), orthogonalized in the fit.Telegrapher lag: O(τ₍tr₎·∂₍t₎), negligible when τ₍tr₎ ≪ τ₍sh₎ (our preregistered shoulder scale).Boundary filter: O(𝒦·Ī), site-constant and absorbed in pre-ignition calibration.These are precisely the nuisance channels we profile in Sec. 4.4 and Sec. 15.1–15.2.

A.10 Contract (what this appendix buys us)A covariant kinetic → moment derivation of the working transport laws used in the paper.A justified rank-1 angular closure with explicit, quadratic-in-anisotropy error bars.A telegrapher interpolation showing why short ignition shoulders are causal and why diffusion does not describe our window.A boundary projector that makes Ī(t) a true single dial up to small, accounted-for filters.Together these elements support the main-text mapping
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎, θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₍0₎,
while keeping anisotropy as a low-rank, decaying nuisance with quantified closure errors.

B. Shadowing → Newton derivation; anisotropy corrections
Aim. Starting from momentum deposition f₍dep₎ = (κρ⁄c₍χ₎)·F and a near-isotropic χ bath, derive the r⁽−2⁾ law by shadowing, identify
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎, and quantify first-order anisotropy corrections from the dipole and tri-lobe patterns {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎}. All notation follows §0.4.

B.1 Ingredients and “thin-sky” limitBath. Specific intensity I(t,Ω) with sky average Ī(t) ≡ (1⁄4π)∫ I dΩ. Near-isotropic closure gives F = c₍χ₎∫ n(Ω)·I dΩ. In the isotropic limit F = 0.Deposition. Force density on matter of density ρ: f₍dep₎ = (κρ⁄c₍χ₎)∫ I(Ω) n(Ω) dΩ. For a full sky this vector integral cancels.Shadow. A body b removes intensity from a small cap Ω₍ba₎ on the sky of a target a; the missing momentum makes a net push toward b.Opacity per mass. Define an effective χ “transport cross-section per unit mass” κ (area per mass). Then the total shadowing cross-section of b is σ₍b₎ ≡ κ·m₍b₎.Thin-sky. Treat caps as small (Ω₍ba₎ ≪ 4π) and non-overlapping; retain terms linear in Ω₍ba₎ and in anisotropy amplitudes.B.2 Pairwise force from a single cap
Consider body a (mass m₍a₎) at separation r from body b (mass m₍b₎). Let n̂₍ab₎ be the unit vector from a to b.
Solid angle of the cap. For σ₍b₎ seen at range r,
Ω₍ba₎ ≈ σ₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾ = (κ·m₍b₎)⁄r⁽2⁾.
Missing momentum flux per area. In the isotropic approximation I(t,Ω) ≈ Ī(t), the vector deficit at a is
ΔΠ̇₍χ₎ ≈ (Ī⁄c₍χ₎)·Ω₍ba₎·n̂₍ab₎.
Total force on a. Deposit this missing flux into a with coefficient κ per unit mass and integrate over its mass:
F⃗₍a←b₎ = (κ·m₍a₎)·ΔΠ̇₍χ₎
= (κ·m₍a₎)·(Ī⁄c₍χ₎)·(κ·m₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾)·n̂₍ab₎.
Therefore,
F⃗₍a←b₎ = [ κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎ ]·( m₍a₎ m₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾ )·n̂₍ab₎.
Identification. Define
G₍eff₎(t) ≡ κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎,
and the law is Newtonian:
F⃗₍a←b₎ = G₍eff₎(t)·( m₍a₎ m₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾ )·n̂₍ab₎.

B.3 Superposition and N-body linearity
Under thin-sky conditions (small caps, negligible overlap), caps add linearly. The net force on a from bodies {b} is
F⃗₍a₎ = ∑₍b≠a₎ G₍eff₎(t)·( m₍a₎ m₍b₎⁄r₍ab₎⁽2⁾ )·n̂₍ab₎ + O(overlap, A⁽2⁾).
“Overlap” terms scale as σ₍b₎σ₍c₎⁄r⁽4⁾ and are negligible when each Ω ≪ 1. Corrections quadratic in anisotropy amplitudes are deferred to §B.6–B.7.

B.4 Equivalence principle and energy bookkeeping
Because κ is per unit mass, both the shadow cast and the deposition received scale ∝ m. Hence inertial and passive gravitational mass enter symmetrically, delivering the universality of free fall in the nonrelativistic limit. Potential energy between a and b is the missing χ flux capacity:
U₍ab₎(r,t) = − G₍eff₎(t)·( m₍a₎ m₍b₎⁄r ),
consistent with the r⁽−2⁾ force and the boundary-driven time dependence.

B.5 Anisotropy corrections (first order)
Write the angular intensity in the anchor frame (AF) as a low-rank expansion
I(t,Ω) = Ī(t)·[ 1 + A₍1₎(t)·P₍1₎(Ω; ê₁) + A₍tri₎(t)·T₍3₎(Ω; anchors) + … ].Dipole term. P₍1₎(Ω; ê₁) ≡ n̂·ê₁.Tri-lobe term. T₍3₎ is a fixed, unit-variance tri-anchor template.For a small cap around n̂₍ab₎, the missing intensity is locally I(t,Ω≈n̂₍ab₎). Thus the pairwise force acquires a fractional modulation
F⃗₍a←b₎ = G₍eff₎(t)·( m₍a₎ m₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾ )·[ 1 + δ₍aniso₎(t, n̂₍ab₎) ]·n̂₍ab₎,
with
δ₍aniso₎ ≈ A₍1₎(t)·( n̂₍ab₎·ê₁ ) + A₍tri₎(t)·T₍3₎( n̂₍ab₎ ) + O(A⁽2⁾).
Lab rotation. As Earth rotates, n̂₍ab₎ precesses in AF, turning δ₍aniso₎ into diurnal/seasonal modulations (§7.2). These are carried in fits as orthogonal regressors with priors centered at 0 (§4.4, §15.1).

B.6 Finite-size and near-field correctionsFinite cap. For larger caps (very small r), the cap integral over n̂ is not exactly Ω·n̂₍ab₎. The next correction is O(Ω²) = O(σ₍b₎²⁄r⁽4⁾), negligible in thin-sky.Multiple scattering. Our transport is streaming; χ–matter interactions appear only as deposition (no χ re-emission into the cap). Any re-emission would enter at higher order in κ and is bounded by guardrails as O(A⁽2⁾, κ²).Cap overlap. When two sources b,c lie nearly collinear as seen from a, shadow overlaps reduce additivity. The correction scales as σ₍b₎σ₍c₎⁄r⁽4⁾ and is dominated by the linear sum unless extreme alignments occur. We carry this as a systematic ceiling in synthetic stress tests.B.7 Retardation and fronts (consistency with causality)
The derivation above is instantaneous in the LF. In reality, I(t,Ω) updates retardedly with speed c₍χ₎; therefore θ₍G₎(t) steps propagate with a front v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ (§7.1, §10.3). The shadowing formula still holds pointwise once the front arrives; before that, δF = 0. Practical fits enforce inner⁄outer causal envelopes.

B.8 Error budget and bounds (carried to analysis)Anisotropy linearization: error O(A⁽2⁾) with amplitudes {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} ≪ 1 and OU decay on τ₍A₎ (§6.4).Cap thinness: error O(σ⁽2⁾⁄r⁽4⁾) = O(κ² m⁽2⁾⁄r⁽4⁾), negligible at lab separations.Closure error (transport): O(b²) where b ≡ |F|⁄(c₍χ₎u) = O(A₍1₎) (§A.9).Retardation: enforced by lag fits; no contribution outside the cone.All appear explicitly as nuisance or veto channels in §14–§15.

B.9 Contract (takeaway)Shadowing → Newton. With σ₍b₎ = κ·m₍b₎ and a thin cap Ω₍ba₎ = σ₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾, momentum deposition gives
 F⃗₍a←b₎ = [ κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎ ]·( m₍a₎ m₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾ )·n̂₍ab₎,
so G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎.Linearity. Pairwise superposition holds to first order; overlap terms are higher order in small caps.Anisotropy. Directional corrections enter multiplicatively as δ₍aniso₎ = A₍1₎(n̂₍ab₎·ê₁) + A₍tri₎·T₍3₎(n̂₍ab₎) + O(A⁽2⁾) and are treated as bounded nuisances that decay post-ignition.Causality. Retarded updates are captured by front-lag geometry; the force law applies after arrival.Together these results justify the main-text mapping from boundary intensity to Newtonian attraction, quantify when and how small anisotropies leak into the force, and keep all corrections explicitly within the analysis and guardrail structure.

C. Boundary calculus & fold bifurcation; J₍c₎ → N₍c₎ = 25; QND capacity formalism
Aim. Make the boundary control explicit, show how a fold (saddle-node) response produces a sharp ignition threshold J₍c₎, and map it to a minimal cardinality N₍c₎ via the operational Nexus quantities (j₍0₎, m₍*₎, C₍QND₎). All symbols follow §0.4.

C.1 Boundary functional and Robin control
We work with the bulk moments u(t,x) (χ energy density) and F(t,x) (flux), driven by anchors and a Nexus sink localized to 𝒟(t):
∂₍t₎u + ∇·F = J₍anc₎ − α·u,  with  α = α₍0₎ + α₍Nx₎(t)·1₍𝒟(t)₎.
At the lab boundary, the controlled Robin condition is
n̂·F − c₍χ₎·u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜(t,Ω),
where the single dial 𝒜(t,Ω) lumps the Nexus effect into the boundary. Let Ī(t) ≡ c₍χ₎·ū(t)⁄(4π) be the sky-average seen by the site. In the streaming limit (§A), Ī(t) follows an effective scalar response
ℛ( Ī ; J₍eff₎ ) = 0,  with  J₍eff₎ ≡ N·j₍0₎·m(t).
Here j₍0₎ is the calibrated per-member drive scale and m(t) the order parameter constrained by the witnesses (§2.4–§2.6).

C.2 Reduced normal form and fold (saddle-node)
Near ignition the boundary response can be written—after nondimensionalization and elimination of slow geometric filters—as the fold normal form in a state variable x ≡ Ī/Ī₍0₎:
ℛ( x ; j ) ≡ x − 1 + σ·j − β·x⁽2⁾ = 0,   with   j ≡ J₍eff₎/J₍0₎.σ (>0) is the coupling slope (how strongly boundary drive reduces intensity).β (>0) is a softening curvature induced by backreaction/geometry.J₍0₎ and Ī₍0₎ are pre-ignition scales fixed in calibration (§13.3).This concave response has a fold where the stable and unstable branches merge.
Fold conditions. Solve ℛ = 0 together with ∂₍x₎ℛ = 0:
∂₍x₎ℛ = 1 − 2β·x = 0  ⇒  x₍c₎ = 1⁄(2β).
Plugging into ℛ = 0 gives the critical drive
σ·j₍c₎ = 1 − x₍c₎ + β·x₍c₎⁽2⁾ = 1 − 1⁄(2β) + 1⁄(4β) = 1 − 1⁄(4β).
Hence
j₍c₎ = [ 1 − 1⁄(4β) ] ⁄ σ,    and    Ī₍c₎ = x₍c₎·Ī₍0₎ = Ī₍0₎⁄(2β).
The ignition manifold is crossed when j ≥ j₍c₎; at that moment the interior jumps to the low-Ī branch and θ₍G₎(t) = Ī/Ī₍0₎ collapses (§6.1–§6.2).

C.3 From j₍c₎ to J₍c₎ (calibration form)
Undoing the normalization gives
J₍c₎ = j₍c₎·J₍0₎ = J₍0₎·[ 1 − 1⁄(4β) ] ⁄ σ.
The pair (σ, β) is identified pre-ignition from small-signal boundary nudges (or, equivalently, from the fitted shoulder curvature right after ignition when back-projected). These numbers, plus J₍0₎, are recorded in the Calibration Card (§14.3).

C.4 Mapping to minimal cardinality: J₍c₎ → N₍c₎
The operational drive is J₍eff₎(t) = N·j₍0₎·m(t). Witnesses and independence audits guarantee a floor m(t) ≥ m₍*₎ over the active window (§2.5–§2.7). Hence a deterministic lower bound
N ≥ J₍c₎ ⁄ ( j₍0₎·m₍*₎ ).
In practice we also guard against dropouts and timing jitter by a safety factor ζ ≥ 1 (pre-registered), giving
N ≥ ζ· J₍c₎ ⁄ ( j₍0₎·m₍*₎ ).   (minimal cardinality bound)
Definition. The ignition cardinality N₍c₎ is the smallest integer satisfying this bound and the QND capacity constraint below. In our preregistration the calibrated numbers produce N₍c₎ = 25; this value is then frozen and never tuned post hoc (§0.5, §2.6).

C.5 QND capacity formalism: C₍QND₎(τ)
Ignition must be quantum-non-demolition capable over a window of duration τ. We formalize this with a capacity metric C₍QND₎(τ) that lower-bounds the precision of a conserved observable read without back-action that would spoil m(t):Definition (operational). Let y(t) be the QND readout stream; within a window τ the per-window Fisher information about a conserved quadrature Q is 𝓕₍QND₎(τ). DefineC₍QND₎(τ) ≡ 𝓕₍QND₎(τ) ⁄ τ.  (information rate proxy)Scaling. For N independent, correctly phased members with single-member information rate r₍0₎,C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ N·r₍0₎   (conservative, independence-only).
If asynchronous entanglement increases effective collective contrast, one can add a positive correlation term ∝ (N²−N)·r₍corr₎; we do not rely on this to set thresholds.Guard. We require capacity above a fixed floor C₍*₎:C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎  over the ignition window.  (QND guard)
All terms {r₍0₎, r₍corr₎, C₍*₎, τ} and the method for 𝓕₍QND₎ estimation (e.g., classical-shadows or QFI lower bound) are preregistered in the Nexus Ops Card (§14.1).

C.6 Joint ignition rule and first-hit semantics
Putting C.4 and C.5 together, the first moment t that satisfies
(i) N(t) ≥ N₍c₎,
(ii) J₍eff₎(t) = N·j₍0₎·m(t) ≥ J₍c₎,
(iii) C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎,
is by definition t₍ign₎. From that instant the boundary equation crosses the fold, Ī(t) drops through Ī₍c₎, and θ₍G₎(t) flows to its post-ignition plateau with the transient k₍sh₎(t) = A₍sh₎·e⁽−t/τ₍sh₎⁾ (§6.3, §14.2.1).

C.7 Receipts, estimates, and how 25 emergesσ, β, J₍0₎ (response). Obtained from pre-ignition boundary nudges (or post-ignition shoulder curvature) with tight errors → j₍c₎, then J₍c₎ via C.3.j₍0₎, m₍*₎ (Nexus). j₍0₎ from single-member calibration runs; m₍*₎ from the witness panel (asynchronous W₍N₎ and depth), both with conservative lower HPDs.ζ (safety). Chosen ≥ 1 to cover measured dropout rates and timing jitter; fixed in preregistration.C₍*₎, r₍0₎ (QND). From QND device specs and control measurements; again use lower HPDs.Compute the bound N ≥ max{ ζ·J₍c₎⁄(j₍0₎·m₍₎), C₍₎⁄r₍0₎ }. The smallest integer meeting both is 25 in our calibration; we record the arithmetic and hashes in the Ignition Ledger and Calibration Card (§14.3).

C.8 Robustness, edge cases, and foilsShoulder–latency degeneracy. A large A₍sh₎ can hide a slightly subcritical J₍eff₎. We break degeneracy by sharing {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎} across lab channels while Δt₍i₎ remain instrument-specific (§15.1–§15.2).Near-misses (j just below j₍c₎). The normal form gives a soft approach with delayed collapse (critical slowing). We treat prolonged pre-cone hints as null until the fold is actually crossed (no claim).Environmental foils. A coincident step in an environmental channel cannot satisfy the lag cone nor the OU decay—both are required by §14.2.Alternate response forms. A bi-quadratic ℛ(x;j) = x − 1 + σ·j − β·x⁽2⁾ − γ·x⁽3⁾ gives the same fold logic; γ terms only shift {σ,β} fits and are absorbed pre-ignition.C.9 Contract (takeaway)The boundary map admits a fold, giving a sharp, computable J₍c₎.Operationally, N₍c₎ follows from J₍c₎ via the inequality N ≥ ζ·J₍c₎⁄(j₍0₎·m₍₎) together with the QND capacity guard C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍₎.With preregistered calibrations, the smallest integer satisfying both is 25, locked before data-taking.All numbers and their HPDs are published in the Calibration Card and Ignition Ledger so any group can recompute N₍c₎ and verify the fold arithmetic.D. PPN mapping proofs; GW linearization (TT; speed = 1)
Aim. Show that the metric sector is GR-standard to 1PN order (γ ≈ 1, β ≈ 1), that a local step in Newton strength enters only through the Newtonian potential’s coefficient (the “one dial” θ₍G₎(t)), and that linearized gravitational waves remain TT-only with speed = 1. χ contributes as a source (stress–energy) but does not alter the graviton kinetic term or add radiative polarizations.

D.1 Einstein-frame setup (what varies and what does not)Action (schematic).
S₍tot₎ = S₍EH₎[g] + S₍m₎[g,ψ] + S₍χ₎[g; u, F, …] + S₍bdy₎[u₍0₎; 𝒜(t,Ω)].
Here S₍EH₎ is the Einstein–Hilbert term with fixed G₍N₎, S₍m₎ the Standard–Model matter, S₍χ₎ the χ transport sector (Appendix A), and S₍bdy₎ imposes the single-dial Robin control at the boundary.Field equations.
G₍μν₎ = 8πG₍N₎ ( T₍μν₎ + T₍χ,μν₎ ).
The kinetic operator of g₍μν₎ is untouched; χ enters only through T₍χ,μν₎, which is small and nearly isotropic in our regime.Newton strength in the lab.
The mechanical force between bodies is dominated by χ shadowing (Appendix B), with coefficient
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎ = θ₍G₎(t)·G₍N₎.
Metric curvature itself still follows GR with G₍N₎. The net nonrelativistic acceleration is equivalent to GR with G → G₍eff₎(t), while the metric potentials’ shape (which sets γ, β, GW) remains GR-standard.D.2 1PN bookkeeping and identification of γ, β
We perform the standard weak-field, slow-motion expansion about Minkowski in harmonic gauge:g₍00₎ = −1 + 2U + 2β·U⁽2⁾ + O(ε⁽3⁾),g₍0i₎ = −(1 + γ)·V₍i₎ + O(ε⁽5⁄2⁾),g₍ij₎ = (1 + 2γ·U)·δ₍ij₎ + O(ε⁽2⁾),with ε the PN counting parameter, U the Newtonian potential built from mass density, and V₍i₎ the standard vector potential.
Key point. Because the graviton kinetic term is unchanged and χ does not modify the structure of the metric field equations at quadratic order in h₍μν₎, the coefficients of U in g₍00₎ and g₍ij₎ remain the GR values:γ = 1 and β = 1 up to small corrections we bound below.Where θ₍G₎(t) enters. The equations of motion for nonrelativistic bodies acquire an extra χ push (Appendix B). Equivalently, one can redefine the effective Newton potential entering the geodesic–plus–push dynamics as
U₍eff₎(t,x) = θ₍G₎(t)·U₍GR₎(x),
so that the measured acceleration is −∇U₍eff₎ to Newtonian order. This rescales the strength, not the shape, of the potentials, leaving γ, β tied to the metric ratios and hence ≈ 1.
Anisotropy and preferred-frame terms. The low-rank leak {A₍1₎, A₍tri₎} enters through a small χ momentum density (flux). Its contribution to g₍0i₎ is quadratic in the anisotropy amplitude in the near-isotropic closure (Appendix A): δg₍0i₎ = O(A⁽2⁾). Thus no 1PN preferred-frame parameters are generated at O(A).

D.3 Light propagation, Shapiro delay, and lensing
Photons couple only to the metric (trace portal is blind to T₍γ₎ = 0). Therefore:Shapiro delay and light bending depend on γ via the combination (1 + γ). With γ ≈ 1 fixed by the kinetic sector, these observables remain GR-like even if θ₍G₎(t) ≠ 1 in the lab.Consistency. Mass parameters used in lensing/time-delay fits are metric–inferred (GR with G₍N₎). Our program’s θ₍G₎(t) affects mechanical attraction; it does not perturb EM propagation at tree level (EM-drift null; §15.3.2). Cosmology neutrality is preserved because domains 𝒟(t) have tiny f_V.D.4 Bound on χ-induced 1PN shifts (why γ, β stay at 1)
Let T₍χ,μν₎ be written in the LF as (u, F, Π) moments (Appendix A). In the near-isotropic regime:T₍χ,00₎ ∼ u, T₍χ,0i₎ ∼ F, T₍χ,ij₎ ∼ Π.The 1PN potentials depend on the trace and anisotropic stress combinations. For a nearly isotropic bath, Π − (u⁄3)·δ contributes only at O(A⁽2⁾).Hence δγ, δβ = O(A⁽2⁾, ε·A, ε·τ₍tr₎⁄τ₍sh₎). With A and τ₍tr₎⁄τ₍sh₎ small by design, γ ≈ 1 and β ≈ 1 at present experimental floors.We carry any residual as a nuisance bounded below analysis sensitivity; a detected shift would trip the PPN guardrail (§15.3.1).

D.5 Equations of motion: how θ₍G₎(t) appears without changing γ, β
A nonrelativistic body of mass m obeys (CM frame)
m·ẍ = −m·∇U₍GR₎ + F⃗₍dep₎,
with F⃗₍dep₎ = +m·(θ₍G₎ − 1)·(−∇U₍GR₎) from shadowing (Appendix B). Therefore
ẍ = −∇[ θ₍G₎(t)·U₍GR₎(x) ]  + O(A, ε·τ₍tr₎⁄τ₍sh₎).
The ratio g₍ij₎⁄g₍00₎ (which defines γ) is unaffected; only the overall Newton strength moves with θ₍G₎. This is why ephemerides/LLR are the right windows to see small θ̄ steps, while light tests (γ) remain GR-like.

D.6 Linearized GWs: TT-only, c₍gw₎ = 1
Linearize g₍μν₎ = η₍μν₎ + h₍μν₎ with |h| ≪ 1 and impose de Donder gauge. Split sources into matter and χ:
□ h̄₍μν₎ = −16πG₍N₎ ( T₍μν₎ + T₍χ,μν₎ ),  with  ∂⁽μ₎ h̄₍μν₎ = 0,
where h̄₍μν₎ is the trace-reversed perturbation and □ is the flat d’Alembertian.Propagation. The wave operator is the Minkowski □, so the phase speed is 1 (our units) → c₍gw₎ = 1. There is no χ-dependent modification of the kinetic term.Polarizations. In the wave zone, choose TT gauge: h₍0μ₎ = 0, h₍ii₎ = 0, ∂ᵢh₍ij₎ = 0. Scalar sources contribute only to the non-radiative trace/longitudinal sectors; with negligible χ anisotropic stress at wavelength scales, they do not generate additional radiative modes. Thus only the two GR TT polarizations propagate.Back-reaction. Any χ stress carried into the wave zone behaves like an ordinary matter source term on the right-hand side; it cannot alter dispersion or polarization without changing the left-hand side, which our construction forbids.This satisfies the GW guardrail (speed = 1, no extra pols; §15.3.1).

D.7 Preferred-frame and rotation terms (why they are absent)
The tri-anchor background selects an AF direction, but its imprint in the metric is suppressed:g₍0i₎ picks up contributions from χ momentum density F only at O(A²) under the near-isotropic closure (Appendix A.9).Any diurnal signatures arise from force deposition (mechanics) and appear in instrument residuals as nuisance templates; they do not enter PPN coefficients.Hence no PPN preferred-frame parameters (α₍1₎, α₍2₎, …) are generated at leading order.

D.8 Summary of the mapping (what is proved)Metric sector fixed: γ ≈ 1, β ≈ 1 follow from the unmodified graviton kinetic term; χ appears only in sources with near-isotropic stress → no 1PN coefficient shifts at leading order.Dial is a strength, not a shape: θ₍G₎(t) rescales the Newtonian strength in the equations of motion without changing the metric ratios that set PPN.Light and GWs stay GR-like: photons see only g₍μν₎ (EM-drift null), and GWs obey □h⁽TT⁾₍ij₎ = 0 outside sources with c₍gw₎ = 1, TT-only polarizations.Anisotropy is a bounded nuisance: any χ-induced g₍0i₎ terms are O(A²) and fall under the anisotropy guardrail.Together these results close the loop between our one-dial, boundary-driven Newton strength and unchanged PPN⁄GW phenomenology, explaining why the program can search for mechanical θ₍G₎(t) steps while all metric tests remain within current bounds.

E. Three-body suppression theorem (full proof) & N-body corollary
Aim. For Newtonian three-body dynamics driven by a non-increasing, integrable-in-time coupling G(t), prove that the mutual potential energy vanishes and that trajectories become asymptotically free in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. Then extend to N bodies. Notation follows §0.4: the Newtonian potential is factored as
U₍0₎(x) ≡ −∑₍a<b₎ m₍a₎m₍b₎⁄r₍ab₎  (so U₍0₎ ≤ 0), and the actual potential is
U(t) ≡ G(t)·U₍0₎(x(t)) (≤ 0). The kinetic energy is T(t) ≡ ½∑ m₍a₎|v₍a₎|², total energy E(t) ≡ T(t)+U(t).

E.1 Hypotheses and basic identities
H1 (coupling). G ∈ C⁽1⁾([0,∞)), non-increasing, G(t) ≥ 0, and ∫₍0₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞. Then G(t) → 0 as t → ∞.
H2 (solution regularity). The three-body solution x(t) = (r₍1₎, r₍2₎, r₍3₎) exists for all t ≥ 0 with no finite-time collisions. (This holds generically for Newtonian three-body data; triple collisions require fine-tuned angular momentum. If near-collisions occur, they are isolated in time; see Remark E.5.)
H3 (CM frame). ∑ m₍a₎ r₍a₎(t) ≡ 0 and ∑ m₍a₎ v₍a₎(t) ≡ 0.
Equations of motion. m₍a₎ r̈₍a₎(t) = −G(t) ∂₍r₍a₎₎U₍0₎(x(t)).
Energy drift. Ė(t) = ∂₍t₎U(t) = Ġ(t)·U₍0₎(x(t)) ≥ 0 (since Ġ ≤ 0 and U₍0₎ ≤ 0). Thus E(t) is non-decreasing.
Lagrange–Jacobi identity. For the CM moment of inertia J(t) ≡ ½∑ m₍a₎|r₍a₎|²,
J̈(t) = 2T(t) + U(t) = 2E(t) − U(t).  (Homogeneity −1 ⇒ ∑ r·F = U.)

E.2 A uniform, late-time non-collision radius
Because finite-time collisions are excluded and Kepler flybys are isolated, there exists T₀ < ∞ s.t.
r₍ab₎(t) ≥ r₍min₎ > 0 for all pairs (a,b) and all t ≥ T₀, or else the separations grow (r₍ab₎ → ∞). We treat both within one envelope by writing
|∇U₍0₎(x(t))| ≤ C₀·(1 + R(t))⁽−2⁾ for t ≥ T₀,
where R(t) ≡ max₍a<b₎ r₍ab₎(t) and C₀ depends on masses only. In particular, if the configuration remains in a bounded set after T₀, then |∇U₍0₎| ≤ C₁ (a constant).

E.3 Finite impulse ⇒ velocity limits
Fix a body a. Its acceleration satisfies
|v̇₍a₎(t)| = |m₍a₎⁻¹ F₍a₎(t)| ≤ m₍a₎⁻¹·G(t)·|∇U₍0₎(x(t))|.
For t ≥ T₀ the bound in §E.2 and H1 give an integrable envelope:
∫₍T₀₎⁽∞⁾ |v̇₍a₎(t)| dt ≤ m₍a₎⁻¹ ∫₍T₀₎⁽∞⁾ G(t)·C₀·(1 + R(t))⁽−2⁾ dt ≤ m₍a₎⁻¹·C₀ ∫₍T₀₎⁽∞⁾ G(t) dt < ∞.
Hence each velocity has a finite total impulse after T₀, so the pointwise limit
v₍a₎(∞) ≡ lim₍t→∞₎ v₍a₎(t)
exists. By H3, ∑ m₍a₎ v₍a₎(∞) = 0 (CM frame).

E.4 Asymptotically free trajectories
Integrate once more:
r₍a₎(t) = r₍a₎(T₀) + v₍a₎(∞)·(t − T₀) + ∫₍T₀₎⁽t⁾ (t − s)·v̇₍a₎(s) ds.
Because v̇₍a₎ is integrable, the remainder ∫ (t − s) v̇₍a₎(s) ds = o(1) as t → ∞ (e.g., by Dirichlet tests with tail ∫ v̇). Therefore
r₍a₎(t) = q₍a₎ + v₍a₎(∞)·t + o(1),  with  q₍a₎ ≡ r₍a₎(T₀) − v₍a₎(∞)·T₀.
That is, each body moves freely (uniformly) up to a vanishing correction. Relative trajectories share the same property in the CM frame.

E.5 Vanishing potential energy
Since G(t) → 0 and U₍0₎(x(t)) is either bounded (if R(t) stays bounded) or tends to 0 (if R(t) → ∞), it follows that
U(t) = G(t)·U₍0₎(x(t)) → 0.
Equivalently, the mutual potential energy vanishes along the flow.

E.6 Theorem (three-body suppression)
Statement. Under H1–H3 and the late-time non-collision envelope of §E.2, the three-body Newton system with time-varying coupling G(t) satisfies:
(i) v₍a₎(∞) exist for a = 1,2,3 and obey ∑ m₍a₎ v₍a₎(∞) = 0 (CM);
(ii) r₍a₎(t) = q₍a₎ + v₍a₎(∞)·t + o(1) as t → ∞ (asymptotically free motion);
(iii) U(t) → 0 (mutual potential energy vanishes).
Proof. §E.3 gives finite impulse and velocity limits. §E.4 yields asymptotically free motion. §E.5 gives U(t) → 0. ∎

E.7 Corollary (N-body dispersion)
Let N ≥ 3 bodies evolve under the same assumptions H1–H3 (now for N bodies) and with the same non-collision envelope after some T₀. Then:All velocities v₍a₎(∞) exist and the CM velocity is 0.The configuration decomposes into a (possibly empty) finite collection of scattering clusters, each moving with a cluster CM velocity and with internal relative velocities converging; in every case U(t) → 0 because G(t) → 0 and U₍0₎ is a sum of 1⁄r terms.Any initially bound cluster (negative internal energy) cannot remain bound at late times: Ė(t) ≥ 0 and G(t) → 0 together force the effective binding potential to evaporate (internal U → 0), so the cluster either (a) freezes (all internal v → 0, a degenerate free motion) or (b) disperses (some internal v → nonzero). In both (a) and (b), the internal dynamics are asymptotically free.(Sketch.) The proof is the same finite-impulse argument: once pairwise accelerations are bounded by G(t) times an integrable envelope, the velocities converge and trajectories linearize. U(t) = G(t)·U₍0₎(x(t)) → 0 termwise, hence in total. ∎

E.8 Diagnostics and rates (practical bounds)Velocity convergence rate. For any t ≥ T ≥ T₀,
|v₍a₎(t) − v₍a₎(T)| ≤ m₍a₎⁻¹ ∫₍T₎⁽t⁾ G(s)·C₀·(1 + R(s))⁽−2⁾ ds ≤ m₍a₎⁻¹·C₀ ∫₍T₎⁽∞⁾ G(s) ds.
Thus the Cauchy tail is controlled by the tail integral of G.Position remainder. |r₍a₎(t) − (q₍a₎ + v₍a₎(∞)·t)| ≤ ∫₍t⁄2₎⁽∞⁾ (s − t⁄2)·|v̇₍a₎(s)| ds = o(1).Virial envelope. J̈(t) = 2E(t) − U(t) ≥ 2E(0), so J(t) is uniformly convex. This prevents recurrent tight clustering at late times when combined with finite impulse (no sustained negative-U trapping).E.9 Remarks and edge cases
R1 (near-collisions). If a finite number of near-collisions occur after T₀, each contributes a finite impulse because the time weight G(t) is small late and the Kepler flyby is of finite measure. The same conclusion holds.
R2 (measure-zero singular sets). Classical three-body triple collisions require zero angular momentum and special initial data. Excluding this meagre set gives H2 generically.
R3 (what the theorem does not assert). We do not claim a universal rate U(t) → 0 beyond the trivial G(t) factor, nor do we forbid the “freeze” outcome (v₍rel₎ → 0) within a bounded cluster; both are asymptotically free in the CM sense.

E.10 Contract (takeaway)
With G(t) monotone and integrable, the χ-driven attraction exerts only a finite late-time impulse. That suffices to make velocities converge and trajectories linearize, while U(t) → 0 because G(t) → 0 and the configuration either spreads or freezes. This proves the three-body suppression regime we use in the paper and extends to N bodies under the same mild, generic regularity assumptions.

F. Cosmology: perturbations with local μ(a); lensing⁄ISW neutrality; f₍V₎ scaling
Goal. Place the boundary–driven dial θ₍G₎(t) into a standard ΛCDM perturbation setup without altering the metric sector tested by cosmology. We (i) define a local mechanical μ, (ii) show why lensing/ISW remain neutral, and (iii) bound any back-reaction by the domain volume fraction f₍V₎ ≪ 1.

F.1 Setup and assumptions (FRW background, local domains)Background. Spatially flat FRW with scale factor a(η) and standard ΛCDM contents. The metric sector is GR-standard; photons and GWs propagate as in GR (Appendix D).Domains. A finite set of compact regions 𝒟ᵢ(η) with fronts moving subluminally (v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎). Let 1₍𝒟(η)₎(x) be the indicator of the union 𝒟(η) = ⋃ᵢ 𝒟ᵢ(η).Dial. Inside each 𝒟ᵢ, the mechanical Newton strength for nonrelativistic matter is rescaled by θ₍G₎(η) ≡ Ī(η)⁄Ī₍0₎; outside, it is 1. We encode this with a local mechanical factor
μ₍mech₎(x,η) ≡ 1 + [θ₍G₎(η) − 1]·1₍𝒟(η)₎(x).Volume fraction. f₍V₎(η) ≡ ⟨1₍𝒟(η)₎⟩ is the comoving volume fraction occupied by domains; our program targets f₍V₎ ≪ 1 at all times.F.2 Scalar perturbations: split between mechanics and metric
Work in Newtonian gauge with scalar potentials Φ and Ψ. We keep the metric Poisson and slip GR-standard,Metric Poisson (light/GW, global): ∇²Φ = 4πG₍N₎ a² ρ₍m₎ δ, Ψ = Φ.Mechanical equation (local, matter motion): test bodies inside 𝒟 feel −∇Φ₍mech₎ with
∇²Φ₍mech₎ = 4πG₍N₎ a² μ₍mech₎(x,η) ρ₍m₎ δ.Thus photons and GWs see the GR potential Φ, while nonrelativistic matter inside 𝒟 experiences a locally rescaled acceleration via Φ₍mech₎. This implements the “metric fixed, dial in mechanics” principle from the main text.

F.3 Linear growth with local μ and its averaging
Let δ be the matter overdensity. On scales where a region stays inside⁄outside a domain for a conformal time interval, its local growth obeys
δ″ + 𝓗·δ′ − 3⁄2·Ω₍m₎(a)·𝓗²·μ₍mech₎·δ = 0,
where 𝓗 ≡ a′⁄a and primes are d⁄dη. For a coarse-grained patch that spends a path-length fraction χ₍path₎ inside domains, the effective growth factor D satisfies
ΔD⁄D ≈ − χ₍path₎·(1 − θ₍G₎)·Ξ(a),
with Ξ(a) an O(1) kernel depending on the background. In a statistically homogeneous medium, the mean χ₍path₎ equals the volume fraction f₍V₎ (mean chord-length theorem), hence
⟨ΔD⁄D⟩ ≲ f₍V₎·|1 − θ₍G₎|.  (first-order bound)
Because f₍V₎ ≪ 1, the global growth history remains ΛCDM-like.

F.4 Lensing neutrality (why κ and Φ₊ stay GR)
The lensing convergence and deflection depend on the Weyl potential Φ₊ ≡ (Φ + Ψ)⁄2 along null geodesics. Since Φ, Ψ obey the GR Poisson equation (above) and μ₍mech₎ does not enter the metric source, we haveTree level: Φ₊ is unchanged; hence weak lensing and CMB lensing kernels remain GR-neutral.Back-reaction ceiling: Any mass rearrangement from modified mechanical growth affects Φ only through δ, and its fractional impact on line-of-sight integrals is O(f₍V₎·|1 − θ₍G₎|) at most (same averaging as in §F.3). With laboratory–to–solar-system domains, this is utterly negligible for survey lensing.F.5 ISW neutrality (Φ̇ suppression and path fraction)
The late–time ISW signal is ΔT⁄T ∝ ∫ dη Φ̇ along CMB paths. In our construction:Metric driver: Φ̇ follows the GR evolution sourced by the cosmic background; the dial does not directly alter Φ̇.Local mass drift: Inside 𝒟, mass motions can, in principle, induce tiny local Φ̇, but the path-length fraction of any CMB ray inside domains is ≈ f₍V₎. Therefore|ΔT⁄T|₍extra₎ ≲ f₍V₎·ε₍loc₎,
with ε₍loc₎ a small number set by local rearrangements (bounded by our weak-field, slow-front regime). Hence ISW neutrality holds to excellent accuracy.

F.6 f₍V₎ scaling laws and encounter statistics
For a statistically homogeneous set of spherical domains with comoving radii {Rᵢ} and number density n,
f₍V₎ = (4⁄3)π n ⟨R³⟩,  and the mean line-of-sight fraction inside domains equals f₍V₎.
The mean number of crossings to distance D is N₍X₎ ≈ n π⟨R²⟩ D, and the mean total chord length is N₍X₎·(4R⁄3), giving again a path fraction ≈ f₍V₎. Thus any line-of-sight observable (lensing, ISW) picks up at most an O(f₍V₎) correction even if the local signal were order-unity.

F.7 Causal envelopes and superhorizon safety
Domain boundaries satisfy |∇T| = 1⁄v₍front₎ with v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1, so no superhorizon or superluminal imprints occur. Ignition transients have finite support k₍sh₎(η) with a characteristic time τ₍sh₎; any induced mechanical-growth change propagates retardedly, further suppressing large-scale coherence. Cosmological two-point statistics therefore remain FRW-consistent.

F.8 Back-reaction and Buchert-style remarks
If desired, one can average the local mechanical stress via a Buchert coarse-graining. The effective kinematical back-reaction term 𝒬 scales as f₍V₎ times domain–internal velocity variances, which are laboratory-scale; hence 𝒬 is far below current background–expansion sensitivities. We therefore keep background expansion fixed and treat any back-reaction as a future, conservative ceiling ∝ f₍V₎.

F.9 Contract (takeaway)We introduce a local mechanical μ that rescales nonrelativistic accelerations only inside domains: μ₍mech₎ = 1 + (θ₍G₎ − 1)·1₍𝒟₎.The metric Poisson equation stays GR; thus lensing and ISW are neutral at tree level.Any induced, second-order cosmological imprint scales as f₍V₎·|1 − θ₍G₎| and is negligible for laboratory⁄solar-system domains.Causal fronts ensure no superhorizon or instantaneous effects.This formalizes why the boundary–driven dial is cosmology-safe while remaining locally testable in the laboratory and ephemerides windows.

G. χ-noise OU model; PSD; cross-site phase & c₍χ₎ inference; lag statistics
Aim. Provide a self-contained stochastic-and-signal framework for θ₍G₎(t) inference with: (i) an OU χ-noise baseline, (ii) analytic PSDs for step–shoulder and OU anisotropy, (iii) multi-site phase methods to extract lags and bound c₍χ₎, and (iv) finite-sample lag statistics with causal-cone vetoes. Symbols follow §0.4.

G.1 Generative model (per site)
At site i with gain a₍i₎ and latency Δt₍i₎, the measured series y₍i₎(t) is
y₍i₎(t) = a₍i₎·θ₍G₎(t − Δt₍i₎) + n₍i₎(t),
with θ₍G₎(t) = 1 + s(t) where s(t) carries the ignition shoulder and OU anisotropy:
s(t) = k₍sh₎(t − t₍ign₎) + s₍A₎(t).Shoulder kernel: k₍sh₎(t) = A₍sh₎·e⁽−t⁄τ₍sh₎⁾·Θ(t).Anisotropy OU (common latent driver): s₍A₎ solves ds₍A₎ = −(1⁄τ₍A₎)·s₍A₎ dt + σ₍A₎ dW, with s₍A₎(t₍ign₎) free.Noise n₍i₎(t) is the χ-noise OU plus instrument terms:
n₍i₎(t) = u₍i₎(t) + ϵ₍i₎(t),
du₍i₎ = −(1⁄τ₍c,i₎)·u₍i₎ dt + σ₍c,i₎ dW₍i₎, ϵ₍i₎ white⁄colored per device.
Front geometry (multi-site lags): Δt₍i₎ = T(x₍i₎) − T(x₍ref₎) with |∇T| = 1⁄v₍front₎ and v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎.

G.2 OU χ-noise: covariance and PSD
For OU process z(t) with dz = −(1⁄τ)·z dt + σ dW, the stationary covariance and one-sided PSD are
Cov[z(t), z(t+τ′)] = σ²·τ·e⁽−|τ′|⁄τ⁾,
S₍z₎(f) = 2σ²·τ ⁄ (1 + (2πfτ)⁽2⁾).
We use this twice:Site noise: S₍u,i₎(f) = 2σ²₍c,i₎·τ₍c,i₎ ⁄ (1 + (2πfτ₍c,i₎)⁽2⁾).Anisotropy: S₍A₎(f) = 2σ²₍A₎·τ₍A₎ ⁄ (1 + (2πfτ₍A₎)⁽2⁾).G.3 Signal PSDs (shoulder and OU)Shoulder. Fourier of k₍sh₎(t) is K₍sh₎(f) = A₍sh₎⁄(1 + i2πfτ₍sh₎). Its power is
|K₍sh₎(f)|² = A²₍sh₎ ⁄ (1 + (2πfτ₍sh₎)⁽2⁾).OU anisotropy. Already given by S₍A₎(f).Total latent s(t). S₍s₎(f) = |K₍sh₎(f)|² + S₍A₎(f) (shoulder is deterministic post-ignition; treat pre vs post windows separately).Per site, ignoring small instrument filters, the observed PSD is
S₍y,i₎(f) ≈ a²₍i₎·S₍s₎(f) + S₍u,i₎(f) + S₍ϵ,i₎(f).
This decomposition makes {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎} identifiable by shape, while a₍i₎ is absorbed in amplitude.

G.4 Cross-site coherence and phase
Let y₍1₎, y₍2₎ be two sites with lags Δt₍1₎, Δt₍2₎ relative to the latent θ₍G₎. The cross-spectrum is
C₁₂(f) ≡ 𝔽[y₍1₎]·𝔽[y₍2₎]⁽*⁾ ≈ a₍1₎a₍2₎·S₍s₎(f)·e⁽−i2πfΔt₁₂⁾ + N₁₂(f),
with Δt₁₂ ≡ Δt₍1₎ − Δt₍2₎ and N₁₂ the colored cross-noise. The coherence
γ²(f) ≡ |C₁₂|² ⁄ (S₍y,1₎ S₍y,2₎)
peaks where S₍s₎ dominates (bands near 1⁄τ₍sh₎ and 1⁄τ₍A₎).
Phase–slope estimator. In a stable band 𝔅, unwrapping the cross-phase ϕ₁₂(f) = arg C₁₂(f) and regressing
ϕ₁₂(f) ≈ −2πfΔt₁₂ + ϕ₀  over f ∈ 𝔅
yields Δt̂₁₂ with standard error ≈ (σϕ⁄(2π))·(12⁄(N f²₍span₎))⁽1⁄2⁾. Choose 𝔅 by coherence threshold γ² ≥ γ²₍min₎ (preregistered).

G.5 Time-domain lags (correlation and matched filters)Cross-correlation. ρ₁₂(τ) = ∫ y₍1₎(t)·y₍2₎(t+τ) dt; the argmax τ̂ that maximizes ρ₁₂ is a crude Δt̂₁₂. For OU noise, ρ₁₂ has a broad peak; we improve SNR by prewhitening with AR(1)/OU inverse filters.Matched-filter onset. For the shoulder, convolve each series with the time-reversed kernel k̄₍sh₎(t) and locate the peak time t̂₍arr,i₎; differences give Δt̂’s. This is robust when A₍sh₎ is visible above noise.Joint estimator. Combine phase–slope and matched-filter Δt̂’s in a small Bayesian fusion: Δt₁₂ ∼ 𝓝(μ₍phase₎,σ²₍phase₎) ∩ 𝓝(μ₍mf₎,σ²₍mf₎), returning the precision-weighted mean.

G.6 Causal-cone tests and c₍χ₎ bounds
Let dᵣᵢ be the projected baseline from ref to site i along the inferred front normal n̂₍front₎ (estimated from multiple Δt̂’s). The cone constraints are
t̂₍arr,i₎ − t̂₍arr,ref₎ ≥ dᵣᵢ ⁄ 1,  and  v̂₍front₎ ≡ dᵣᵢ ⁄ (t̂₍arr,i₎ − t̂₍arr,ref₎) ≤ c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.
We set a hard veto if any pre-cone breach occurs: t̂₍arr,i₎ − t₍ign₎ < dᵢ⁄1. The 95% bound on c₍χ₎ comes from the posterior of v₍front₎, truncated to (0,1].
Multi-site geometry (≥ 3 sites) gives a consistent v̂₍front₎ via overdetermined regression of arrival times on projected distances.

G.7 Hierarchical state-space fit (Kalman⁄smooth)
Discretize at cadence Δ:
Latent
s₍A₎⁽k+1⁾ = ϕ₍A₎·s₍A₎⁽k⁾ + η⁽k⁾, ϕ₍A₎ ≡ e⁽−Δ⁄τ₍A₎⁾, η ∼ 𝓝(0, q₍A₎).
θ₍G₎⁽k⁾ = 1 + s₍A₎⁽k⁾ + A₍sh₎·e⁽−(t₍k₎−t₍ign₎)⁄τ₍sh₎⁾·Θ(t₍k₎−t₍ign₎).
Observations
y₍i₎⁽k⁾ = a₍i₎·θ₍G₎⁽k−ℓᵢ⁾ + u₍i₎⁽k⁾ + ϵ₍i,white⁾⁽k⁾,
u₍i₎⁽k+1⁾ = ϕ₍c,i₎·u₍i₎⁽k⁾ + ξ₍i⁾⁽k⁾.
Here ℓᵢ ≡ round(Δt₍i₎⁄Δ). Unknowns {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, a₍i₎, Δt₍i₎, τ₍c,i₎, σ’s} are inferred by maximizing the marginal likelihood or via MCMC on the state-space model. The Kalman smoother returns the latent θ̂₍G₎(t) and ŝ₍A₎(t), enabling posterior decomposition of shoulder vs anisotropy.

G.8 Lag statistics: uncertainties, nulls, and false positivesPhase-slope variance. With coherence γ² and K independent tapers, the asymptotic Var[ϕ] ≈ (1 − γ²)⁄(2Kγ²). Propagate to σ²(Δt̂) by the regression formula in §G.4.Correlation peak false-alarm. For prewhitened Gaussian noise, the maximum of |ρ₁₂(τ)| over M lags has tail P₍FA₎(u) ≈ 1 − [Φ(u)]ᴹ. Set u from the observed peak; report P₍FA₎ and require P₍FA₎ ≤ α₍pre₎ (preregistered).Von Mises phase locking. Phase residuals Δϕ around the fitted slope follow approximately a Von Mises law VM(κ₍vm₎); demand κ₍vm₎ above a floor ensuring tight unwrapping.Pre-cone veto power. Under the null of no signal, the chance that noise fabricates a consistent pre-cone sequence across ≥ 3 sites is exponentially tiny; we record a veto receipt listing all pre-cone checks.G.9 Practical windows and band selectionShoulder band. f ∈ [f₍L₎, f₍H₎] with f₍L₎ ≈ 1⁄(10τ₍sh₎), f₍H₎ ≈ 1⁄τ₍sh₎.Anisotropy band. f ≲ 1⁄τ₍A₎ (very low); often phase-incoherent, used mainly for OU fits.Notch ENV. Preregistered notches for diurnal⁄semi-diurnal windows; apply the same to all sites before cross-spectral analysis.Use multitaper (K ≥ 3) to stabilize C₁₂ and reduce leakage.

G.10 Synthetic stress tests (receipts)
We release synthetic campaigns with known {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, v₍front₎} and realistic ENV overlays. A pass requires recovery within preregistered HPDs and correct causal ordering in ≥ 95% of trials. The synthetic design matrix is part of the ODF pack; hashes appear in the receipt (§16.2).

G.11 What ships in packs (minimal fields)LAG pack. Onsets per site {t̂₍arr,i₎, σ₍t,i₎}, projected baselines dᵣᵢ, v̂₍front₎ with HPD, c₍χ₎ 95% bound, pre-cone flags (none true for a valid run), phase–slope plots and κ₍vm₎.ANI pack. τ̂₍A₎ with HPD, OU PSD overlays, residual checks after removing θ̂₍G₎ shoulder.ODF pack. S₍y,i₎(f), C₁₂(f), γ²(f), taper specs, band choices, and code seeds.G.12 Contract (takeaway)
An OU baseline delivers closed-form PSDs, the step–shoulder supplies a narrowband phase handle, and multi-site cross-phase plus matched filtering yields robust lags. Causal-cone checks convert lags into c₍χ₎ bounds without ambiguity. All estimators have explicit uncertainties and false-alarm controls, and every ingredient is packaged in receipts so a third party can replicate the inference end to end.

H. Strong-field χ on Kerr; BH thermodynamics; GSL details
Goal. Put the χ–transport picture on a Kerr background, compute horizon fluxes, and show: (i) the area theorem holds (χ respects NEC/ANEC in our regime), (ii) the first law is unmodified in form with χ entering only via stress–energy fluxes, (iii) GWs remain TT-only (Appendix D), and (iv) superradiant effects of χ are negligible for near-isotropic baths around SMBHs. We work in the Einstein frame with fixed G₍N₎; all variation lives in mechanical forces outside the hole, not in the metric sector.

H.1 Kerr setup and framesGeometry. Stationary, axisymmetric Kerr spacetime with mass M and spin a; timelike and axial Killing fields t⁽μ₎ and ϕ⁽μ₎. Horizon generator χ⁽μ₎₍H₎ ≡ t⁽μ₎ + Ω₍H₎ ϕ⁽μ₎, where Ω₍H₎ is the horizon angular velocity; surface gravity κ₍sg₎.Observers. Use the ZAMO tetrad near the hole and an asymptotic lab frame (LF) far away. χ-quanta propagate with characteristic speed c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 (Appendix A).χ sector. Treat χ as a neutral, radiation-like carrier with stress–energy T₍χ,μν₎ ≈ u·k₍μ₎k₍ν₎ + subleading angular moments (near-isotropic closure; Appendix A). Here k⁽μ₎ is future null (or nearly null if c₍χ₎ < 1 in medium units). We assume Hadamard regularity and the null energy condition (NEC) T₍χ,μν₎ k⁽μ₎k⁽ν₎ ≥ 0 along null k⁽μ₎.H.2 Liouville transport on Kerr; capture vs scatter
The covariant Boltzmann (Liouville–RTA) equation for the one-particle distribution f(x,p) reads p⁽μ₎∇₍μ₎f = collisions − sinks. Stationarity implies constants of motion (E, L₍z₎, Q) along geodesics. In the streaming regime (τ₍tr₎ large; Appendix A), the χ intensity I(x,Ω) follows null geodesic flow.
Horizon capture. Modes with impact parameter below b₍cap₎(ω,m,a) cross the light ring and are absorbed. The frequency-resolved absorption factor Γ₍abs₎(ω,m,a) is O(1) at high ω·M and reduces to geometric optics: σ₍abs₎ ≈ 27πM² for massless radiation; spin and m-couplings modulate this by O(a/M). For a near-isotropic bath, the net power into the hole is
P₍χ→BH₎ ≈ Ī·σ₍abs₎·[1 + O(A₍1₎, A₍tri₎)],
with A₍1₎ and A₍tri₎ the low-rank anisotropy amplitudes (Appendix A,B). For SMBHs, σ₍abs₎ is macroscopic and the capture dominates any coherent scattering.

H.3 Area theorem with χ (Raychaudhuri route)
Let 𝓝 be the null horizon congruence with tangent k⁽μ₎ = χ⁽μ₎₍H₎ (affinely reparametrized). The Raychaudhuri equation
θ̇ = −½θ² − σ² − 8πG₍N₎ T₍μν₎ k⁽μ₎k⁽ν₎
governs the expansion θ of 𝓝. With T₍μν₎ = T₍m,μν₎ + T₍χ,μν₎ and NEC for both matter and χ, the rightmost term is ≤ 0; together with σ² ≥ 0 this implies θ cannot increase from nonpositive values. Standard global arguments then give
dA⁄dv ≥ 0,
i.e., the horizon area never decreases in any classical χ influx. Since our construction leaves the Einstein equations intact, the Hawking area theorem holds with χ included as ordinary matter.

H.4 Horizon fluxes and the first law with χ
Define the fluxes of energy and angular momentum across the future horizon:Power: 𝒫 ≡ ∫₍H₎ T₍μν₎ t⁽μ₎ k⁽ν₎ dΣ,Torque: 𝒯 ≡ −∫₍H₎ T₍μν₎ ϕ⁽μ₎ k⁽ν₎ dΣ.Quasi-stationary perturbations then satisfy the physical process first law:
dM = (κ₍sg₎⁄8πG₍N₎) dA + Ω₍H₎ dJ + (Φ₍H₎ dQ if present),
with dM = 𝒫·dv and dJ = 𝒯·dv given by the total stress (ordinary matter + χ). No extra “χ term” appears on the left because χ does not alter the gravitational kinetic sector; it only carries flux through the horizon or does mechanical work outside. The Clausius identification δQ₍H₎ = (κ₍sg₎⁄8πG₍N₎) δA remains valid.

H.5 Superradiance: why χ does not spin down SMBHs
For bosonic waves on Kerr, superradiance amplifies modes with ω < m·Ω₍H₎, extracting BH rotational energy. For a broad, near-isotropic χ bath:Mode occupation N(ω,m) is approximately even in m and broad in ω; the net superradiant window is a measure-suppressed sliver of phase space.The net horizon power is𝒫₍net₎ ∝ ∑₍ℓ,m₎ ∫ dω Γ₍abs₎(ω,ℓ,m,a)·(ω − mΩ₍H₎)·N(ω,m),
which is positive when N is isotropic because the integral is dominated by ω > mΩ₍H₎. Anisotropy shifts N by δN/N = O(A₍1₎, A₍tri₎); hence any negative superradiant contribution is bounded by
|𝒫₍SR₎| ≤ O(A₍1₎ + A₍tri₎)·𝒫₍χ→BH₎.
Given A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ ≪ 1 in our domain and σ₍abs₎ large for SMBHs, the horizon gains energy overall. Thus χ does not produce significant spin-down or area decrease in the astrophysical regime we consider.

H.6 χ near the light ring; wave vs transport consistency
At r ≈ r₍ph₎ (photon orbit), geometric capture and wave greybody factors agree to leading order. Our transport closure (Appendix A) remains valid provided the angular mean-free path ≫ r₍g₎ and the angular moments beyond rank-1 are small (Π close to u·n̂⊗n̂). Corrections scale as O(A₍1₎², A₍tri₎²) and are profiled as nuisances; they cannot overturn the area theorem or the first law.

H.7 Membrane viewpoint and “χ-work” outside
In the membrane paradigm, the horizon acts as a dissipative surface with surface resistivity and shear viscosity. χ impinges with momentum flux Π̇₍χ₎; part is absorbed (raising A), while outside the hole, χ deposits momentum into ordinary matter via the trace portal, producing the mechanical push used in our Newton law derivation (Appendix B). Energy conservation partitions the χ flux into:absorbed at the horizon (area increase),deposited into matter (mechanical work),scattered to infinity (small for SMBHs).No new gravitational term is needed; χ-work is ordinary matter work in the exterior spacetime.

H.8 GSL: generalized second law with χ
Define the generalized entropy S₍gen₎ ≡ A⁄(4G₍N₎) + S₍out₎, where S₍out₎ is the von Neumann entropy of quantum fields (SM + χ) outside the horizon, computed on a Cauchy slice anchored to the horizon cross-section.
Assumptions. (i) Semiclassical regime, small back-reaction; (ii) χ and SM fields in Hadamard states; (iii) ANEC holds along horizon generators; (iv) unitary evolution outside.
Outline. Relative entropy monotonicity between the actual state and the stationary Hartle–Hawking–like reference across nested outside algebras implies
ΔS₍out₎ ≤ ΔK,
with K the modular Hamiltonian that equals the boost energy flux across the horizon. The physical process first law identifies ΔA⁄(4G₍N₎) = ΔK when ANEC holds. Hence
ΔS₍gen₎ = Δ(A⁄4G₍N₎) + ΔS₍out₎ ≥ 0.
Therefore the GSL holds with χ included: χ contributes to S₍out₎ and to the horizon boost energy, but the inequality survives under our assumptions.

H.9 Extreme and small black holes (limits)Extremal spins. As a → M, Ω₍H₎ rises and the superradiant window broadens. The isotropy of the bath still keeps |𝒫₍SR₎| small relative to capture unless A₍1₎ grows; our analysis requires A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ ≪ 1.Stellar-mass BHs. For smaller M, wave effects are more pronounced and σ₍abs₎ departs from 27πM² at relevant frequencies. Our transport closure remains qualitatively valid but quantitative bounds should use wave greybody factors; this is a to-do in the strong-field pack.H.10 Contract (takeaway)Einstein equations unchanged ⇒ the area theorem and the first law hold with χ counted in T₍μν₎.A near-isotropic χ bath feeds SMBHs: P₍χ→BH₎ ≈ Ī·σ₍abs₎; superradiant extraction is suppressed by O(A₍1₎ + A₍tri₎) and negligible.χ does work outside via momentum deposition; nothing in the BH mechanics needs modification.Under standard semiclassical assumptions (Hadamard + ANEC), the GSL is satisfied with χ included.Thus the strong-field behavior of χ is consistent with the GR thermodynamic structure, while leaving our one-dial Newton-strength control entirely in the weak-field, exterior domain where our experiments live.

I. Gauge neutrality & loop bounds; positivity ⁄ dispersion ⁄ unitarity
Aim. Specify an operator basis in which χ is gauge neutral at tree level (no direct χ·F⁽2⁾ terms), quantify the loop-induced gauge legs and their running to the lab scale, and impose S-matrix guardrails (positivity, dispersion, unitarity, subluminality). These conditions ensure the one-dial program cannot sneak in extra forces or EM drifts.

I.1 Tree-level portal and gauge neutrality
We work in the Einstein frame with fixed G₍N₎. The interaction is a trace portal to ordinary matter:Portal (non-derivative form). 𝓛₍int₎ = g·χ₍d₎·T₍m₎, where χ₍d₎ is the dilaton-like scalar and T₍m₎ ≡ T⁽μ⁾₍m,μ₎.Equivalence principle. In the nonrelativistic limit T₍m₎ → ρ, so the response is mass-proportional (EP-safe).Gauge neutrality. For gauge fields with classical traceless stress (e.g., EM), T₍γ₎ = 0 at tree level ⇒ no χ·F⁽2⁾ term is present initially. Hence photons and classical GW propagation remain metric-only (Appendix D).We also allow a derivative rewriting (redundant up to EOM):𝓛₍int,der₎ = (∂χ₍d₎)²·ℂ₍2₎ + χ₍d₎·∂·J, chosen so that on shell it reduces to g·χ₍d₎·T₍m₎; this makes power counting transparent in EFT.I.2 Loop-induced gauge legs (anomaly and thresholds)
Even with tree-level neutrality, loops generate small couplings to gauge fields:Trace anomaly route. The renormalized trace contains β-functions: T₍m₎ ⊃ (β₍a₎⁄2g₍a₎)·F⁽a⁾². Integrating out charged species at scale μ gives
𝓛₍χF²₎ = c₍EM₎(μ)·χ₍d₎·F² + c₍g₎(μ)·χ₍d₎·G² + …,
with c₍EM₎, c₍g₎ ∝ g times loop factors and charge content.Heavy thresholds. If χ₍d₎ talks to massive fermions ψ via y·χ₍d₎·ψ̄ψ, closing the ψ loop yields χ₍d₎·F² with coefficient ∝ y·Q²·α⁄(4π·m₍ψ₎).Running. c₍EM₎(μ) obeys a mild RG flow; we evaluate at μ₍lab₎. Our guardrail treats c₍EM₎ as a nuisance ceiling constrained by clock nulls, astrophysical bounds, and composition tests, and we propagate it through §15 without letting it emulate θ₍G₎(t).Consequence. EM-constant drift and photon–χ mixing remain loop-suppressed; at our sensitivities these legs are modeled but required to sit below pre-registered ceilings (EM-drift null in §15.3).

I.3 EFT basis and allowed operators (power counting)
Up to dimension-6, respecting Lorentz and gauge symmetries:Portal tower: χ₍d₎·T₍m₎, χ₍d₎²·T₍m₎⁄f, (∂χ₍d₎)²·χ₍d₎⁄f, …Gauge-neutral at tree level: forbid χ₍d₎·F² and χ₍d₎·G² in the UV matching; allow only loop-generated c₍EM₎, c₍g₎ as above.Derivative self-interactions: (∂χ₍d₎)⁴⁄Λ⁽4⁾ with positive Wilson coefficient (see positivity below).No fifth forces: Composition dependence enters only through loops; any χ-mediated composition signal is bounded as a nuisance and cannot trigger a claim (§15.3).All EFT coefficients are referenced at a cutoff Λ₍EFT₎ ≫ μ₍lab₎ so that truncation errors are small.

I.4 Positivity (forward-limit dispersion constraints)
Analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry of 2→2 scattering imply positivity bounds on Wilson coefficients (forward limit s → ∞ with t → 0⁺):χ–χ elastic. The forward amplitude 𝓜₍χχ→χχ₎(s,0) gives
∂²₍s₎𝓜 |₍s=0,t→0⁺₎ ∝ c₍∂χ⁴₎ > 0,
requiring the coefficient of (∂χ₍d₎)⁴ to be positive (no superluminal shocks, healthy UV).χ–matter elastic. For scalar matter ϕ, forward 𝓜₍χϕ→χϕ₎ yields positivity for the product g² and for mixed derivative operators (∂χ₍d₎)²·ϕ²⁄Λ⁽2⁾. This enforces attractive low-energy optical theorems and forbids sign choices that would create acausal phase velocities.Photon channel (if loops kept). The forward χγ→χγ dispersion integral implies c₍EM₎ ≥ 0 for the leading analytic piece (after subtracting IR poles), bounding the loop-induced χ·F² sign consistent with a standard UV completion.Interpretation. These conditions rule out EFT corners that could mimic θ₍G₎(t) via pathological interference or create superluminal group speeds. We keep only positive combinations in priors.

I.5 Subluminality and causal cones
For weak background gradients, the χ₍d₎ fluctuations propagate with characteristic speed c₍χ₎ set by the quadratic kinetic term. Positivity of (∂χ₍d₎)⁴ ensures no background-induced superluminal cones (no “Galileon-like” wing). Our lag geometry (§G) imposes c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 empirically; any recovered v̂₍front₎ > 1 within HPD is a hard refutation (guardrail).

I.6 Unitarity: partial waves and spectral boundsOptical theorem. Im 𝓜₍χχ→χχ₎(s,0) ≥ 0 fixes the sign of absorptive parts; with small loop legs the total width Γ₍χ→γγ₎ is tiny and consistent with the portal picture (no rapid χ depletion).Partial waves. For χ–matter scattering at c.m. energy √s, a₍ℓ₎ obey |Re a₍ℓ₎| ≤ ½. With portal coupling g and cutoff Λ₍EFT₎, this yields a parametric ceiling on g·√s⁄Λ₍EFT₎. Our lab scales satisfy √s ≪ Λ₍EFT₎, so the one-dial changes in θ₍G₎ do not threaten unitarity.Källén–Lehmann. The χ two-point function has a positive spectral density ρ₍χ₎(μ²) ≥ 0; any effective massless pole or light continuum must respect positivity. We assume a gap above μ₍lab₎ (or pure transport), preventing unforeseen resonances that could fake anisotropy templates.I.7 Loop-leg bounds as analysis nuisances
We encode loop contact terms as nuisance ceilings in the inference:EM leg. 𝓛 ⊃ c₍EM₎·χ₍d₎·F². Its leading observables are (i) EM-constant drift, (ii) tiny birefringence or phase-speed shifts in media. The analysis imposes c₍EM₎ ≤ c₍EM,max₎ from clock nulls and astrophysical priors and profiles it out so it cannot absorb θ₍G₎(t).Gluon leg. 𝓛 ⊃ c₍g₎·χ₍d₎·G² could induce composition dependence via nucleon mass fractions; we carry a composition-null guardrail and restrict c₍g₎ to the prior ceiling from Eötvös-type bounds.Running. c(μ) are evolved to μ₍lab₎; priors include RG uncertainty bands so that fit results are robust to mild running.I.8 No metric back-doors
Our construction leaves S₍EH₎ untouched; there are no non-minimal χ₍d₎·R operators in the working EFT below Λ₍EFT₎. This prevents PPN coefficient shifts from operator mixing. Any detected γ ≠ 1 or β ≠ 1 would quarantine the claim (Appendix D, §15.3).

I.9 What would violate consistencyA required negative (∂χ₍d₎)⁴ coefficient to fit data (breaks positivity).Evidence for superluminal fronts (v̂₍front₎ > 1) inconsistent with c₍χ₎ ≤ 1.A fit demanding large c₍EM₎ or c₍g₎ that conflicts with EM-drift null or composition-null guardrails.Any need for χ-metric kinetic mixing that alters GW speed or adds polarizations.I.10 Contract (takeaway)Gauge neutrality at tree level (trace portal only) keeps photons and metric tests GR-like.Loop legs to F² and G² exist but are modeled as small nuisances bounded by external nulls and carried through the fit.Positivity/dispersion enforce the signs of key operators and guarantee healthy, subluminal propagation.Unitarity and spectral positivity hold trivially at lab scales given Λ₍EFT₎ ≫ μ₍lab₎.Together these constraints keep the one-dial program inside a tight EFT cone: no hidden gauge forces, no acausal propagation, no PPN leakage—leaving θ₍G₎(t) as the only adjustable physical effect in the lab.

J. Dilaton Weyl map; trace-portal derivation; RG handling
Goal. Exhibit the Weyl map between Jordan and Einstein frames; derive the trace portal χ₍d₎·T₍m₎ from broken scale symmetry; connect UV numbers {C₍χ₎, f, ξ} to the lab dial via κ ≡ C₍χ₎⁄f; and record RG/trace-anomaly handling so gauge legs remain loop-suppressed and guardrails in §15 stay intact.

J.1 Frames and the Weyl map
We begin in a Jordan-like frame (JF) where the dilaton χ₍d₎ can carry a non-minimal curvature term and matter is minimally coupled:JF action (schematic).
𝒮₍JF₎ = ∫ d⁴x √−g̃ [ ½ ( M⁽2⁾ + ξ·Φ⁽2⁾ ) R̃ − ½(∂Φ)² − V(Φ) ] + 𝒮₍m₎[ g̃₍μν₎, ψ ].Spontaneous breaking. Let Φ take a vacuum value f; write Φ = f + χ₍d₎.Weyl map to EF. Choose Ω²(χ₍d₎) ≡ 1 + ξ·Φ⁽2⁾⁄M⁽2⁾ and set
g₍μν₎ = Ω⁻² g̃₍μν₎,  so the Einstein-frame (EF) gravity term is canonical ½ M⁽2⁾ R.Matter coupling under Weyl. 𝒮₍m₎[ g̃, ψ ] = 𝒮₍m₎[ Ω² g, ψ ] generates the dilaton–matter interaction. Expanding Ω around χ₍d₎ = 0 gives the trace portal.J.2 Trace portal from Weyl variation (derivation)
For an infinitesimal Weyl rescaling g̃₍μν₎ → e⁽2σ₎ g₍μν₎, variation of the matter action yields
δ𝒮₍m₎ = ½ ∫ d⁴x √−g · T₍m₎ · δ(ln g⁻¹) = ∫ d⁴x √−g · σ · T₍m₎,
with T₍m₎ ≡ T⁽μ⁾₍m,μ₎ the matter trace (improved as needed; §J.6). Identifying σ = δ(ln Ω) gives, to leading order in χ₍d₎,Weyl factor. Ω(χ₍d₎) = Ω₀ · exp[ χ₍d₎⁄f + O(χ₍d₎⁽2⁾⁄f⁽2⁾) ] after field redefinitions, with Ω₀ a constant absorbed in units.Portal. 𝓛₍int₎ = (χ₍d₎⁄f) · T₍m₎ + O(χ₍d₎⁽2⁾).This is the trace portal used throughout. In the nonrelativistic limit, T₍m₎ → ρ (mass density), so the response is composition-universal at tree level (EP-safe). Gauge fields are traceless classically (T₍γ₎ = 0), so no tree χ₍d₎·F⁽2⁾ term appears.

J.3 Planck normalization and calibration constants
The JF non-minimal term shifts the effective Planck mass. After the Weyl map,Effective Planck scale. M²₍eff₎ = M⁽2⁾ + ξ·f⁽2⁾.Pre-ignition calibration (main text). The push sector determines the mechanical Newton strength via
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎,  with  κ ≡ C₍χ₎⁄f.
Matching to the metric Newton G₍N₎ before ignition gives the fixed relation
κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1 ⁄ [ 8π · M²₍eff₎ ] = 1 ⁄ [ 8π ( M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ ) ].Thus {C₍χ₎, f, ξ} and {Ī₍0₎, c₍χ₎} jointly fix the one-time calibration; after that, only θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)⁄Ī₍0₎ moves.

J.4 From portal to push: κ and the cross-section per mass
The portal mediates χ→matter momentum exchange. In kinetic language (Appendix A), integrating the χ–matter collision kernel over the χ intensity fixes a transport cross-section per unit mass:Definition. σ₍χm₎⁄m ≡ κ = C₍χ₎⁄f.
C₍χ₎ is a UV-computable overlap (Track A⁄B); f is the dilaton scale.Shadowing law. With σ₍b₎ = κ·m₍b₎, a small sky cap Ω₍ba₎ = σ₍b₎⁄r⁽2⁾ is removed, giving the r⁽−2⁾ force with
G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾·Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎  (Appendix B).This is the exact bridge from the dilaton portal to the one-dial mechanical Newton strength.

J.5 Trace anomaly and RG (how loops enter, how we bound them)
Scale symmetry is broken explicitly by masses and quantum mechanically by the trace anomaly:Ward identity. ∂·D = T₍m₎ = ∑ m₍i₎(1+γ₍m,i₎)·ψ̄ᵢψᵢ + ∑₍a₎ (β₍a₎⁄2g₍a₎)·F⁽a⁾² + … .Loop-induced gauge legs. Even with tree-level neutrality, integrating out charged states generates
𝓛 ⊃ c₍EM₎(μ)·χ₍d₎·F² + c₍g₎(μ)·χ₍d₎·G²,
with c₍EM₎, c₍g₎ ∝ (C₍χ₎⁄f) times loop factors and charge content.Running to μ₍lab₎. We evolve c(μ) from the UV match through thresholds; at μ₍lab₎ we impose nuisance ceilings from clocks, Eötvös-type bounds, and astrophysical limits (Appendix I). These legs are carried in inference but cannot mimic θ₍G₎(t).Portal running. The coefficient of χ₍d₎·T₍m₎ receives mild anomalous-dimension dressing; we absorb it into C₍χ₎(μ). Tracks A⁄B supply C₍χ₎ at a UV scale with integer-structure rigidity (λ, q₍a₎); RG slides it down with uncertainties published in the Calibration Card.J.6 Improved stress tensor and scheme choices
The matter trace is scheme-dependent up to improvements. We adopt the Callan–Coleman–Jackiw improvement so that, for free scalars, T⁽μ⁾₍μ₎ → 0 at the classical fixed point. Consequences:Clean portal. The leading portal is χ₍d₎·T₍m₎ with T₍m₎ free of spurious derivative mixings; derivative couplings are pushed to higher order and counted in EFT power counting (§I.3).Gauge neutrality at tree level. With the improved tensor, classical gauge fields remain traceless, keeping χ–photon coupling purely anomalous/loop.This choice is recorded so that independent analyses can reproduce the mapping.

J.7 Thresholds, decoupling, and matchingHeavy species. Integrating out a heavy fermion ψ of mass M₍ψ₎ and charge Q adds Δc₍EM₎ ∝ (C₍χ₎⁄f)·Q²·α⁄(4π·M₍ψ₎). Thresholds are summed once at matching; below the lightest charged mass, running is tiny.Gluonic leg. Matching across heavy quark thresholds induces χ₍d₎·G² with coefficients tied to β₍QCD₎. Composition tests bound the induced effective composition dependence; we encode it as a prior ceiling (Appendix I.7).Decoupling. All loop legs decouple as μ⁄M → 0; at lab scales they remain well below our EM-drift null sensitivity, by preregistered design.J.8 What would falsify the portal pictureA fit requiring tree-level–sized χ·F² at μ₍lab₎ (violates gauge neutrality and clock nulls).PPN shifts (γ, β) inconsistent with the EF kinetic sector being GR-standard (Appendix D).Anomalous running forcing negative higher-derivative coefficients (violates positivity; Appendix I.4).EM-constant drift or composition dependence exceeding nuisance ceilings while trying to absorb θ₍G₎(t).Any of the above triggers quarantine per §15.4.

J.9 Contract (what this appendix buys us)Derivation: The χ₍d₎·T₍m₎ portal is the inevitable linear coupling from the Weyl map with broken scale symmetry; it is EP-safe and gauge-neutral at tree level.Calibration bridge: The JF non-minimal term yields M²₍eff₎ = M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾, giving the pre-ignition match κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = [8π M²₍eff₎]⁻¹. UV numbers {C₍χ₎, f, ξ} thus fix κ = C₍χ₎⁄f and close the loop to the one dial θ₍G₎(t).RG hygiene: Loop-induced gauge legs exist but are small, RG-controlled, and profiled as nuisances; they cannot fake θ₍G₎.Consistency: Improvement, positivity, and decoupling keep the EFT inside a healthy cone—no new polarizations, no superluminality, no PPN leakage—so all metric guardrails remain green while the mechanical dial does the experimental work.K. UV details Track A: β-functions; critical exponents; flow to f, Z₍ψ,0₎; C₍χ₎
Aim. Give a concrete, minimal asymptotic-safety⁺FN (Track A) scaffolding that (i) admits a predictive UV fixed point, (ii) generates a finite symmetry-breaking scale f by dimensional transmutation, (iii) delivers a calculable normalization C₍χ₎ for the dilaton–trace portal, and (iv) preserves a one-parameter FN structure y₍a₎ ∼ λ⁽q₍a₎⁾ with λ ≡ f⁄M₍*₎. The only lab-facing combination is κ ≡ C₍χ₎⁄f, which anchors G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎.

K.1 Field content and dimensionless couplings (summary)
Work in the Einstein frame with fixed G₍N₎ and a real scalar Φ (the dilaton progenitor), non-minimal coupling ξ, and a FN U(1)₍FN₎ flavon alignment (identify S ≡ Φ for the single-scale option).
Dimensionless couplings at renormalization scale μ:g₍G₎(μ) ≡ μ²·G₍N₎·𝔃₍G₎  (dimensionless Newton, includes grav. wavefunction factor 𝔃₍G₎).λ₍Φ₎(μ) for V(Φ) = (λ₍Φ₎⁄4) Φ⁴, with minimal portal to matter only through the trace.ξ(μ) for non-minimal term ½ ξ Φ²R (its EF imprint reappears in the Weyl map).y₍a₎(μ) for SM Yukawas (enter only to define Z₍ψ,0₎ and the FN map).g₍FN₎(μ) for the U(1)₍FN₎ (optional weak gauging of the flavor symmetry).We denote the vector of couplings by g⃗ ≡ (g₍G₎, λ₍Φ₎, ξ, {y₍a₎}, g₍FN₎).

K.2 β-system near the UV fixed point
To leading nontrivial orders (one loop in matter, leading graviton-exchange correction), writeβ₍G₎ ≡ μ∂₍μ₎ g₍G₎ = +2·g₍G₎ − b₍G₎·g₍G₎⁽2⁾ + O(g₍G₎³),β₍λ₎ = a₀·λ₍Φ₎⁽2⁾ − a₁·g₍G₎·λ₍Φ₎ + a₂·g₍G₎⁽2⁾ + O(λ₍Φ₎³, g₍G₎³),β₍ξ₎ = c₁·λ₍Φ₎·(ξ − ξ₍c₎) − c₂·g₍G₎·(ξ − ξ₍c₎) + O((ξ − ξ₍c₎)²),β₍y₎ = y·(γ₍ψ₎ + ½γ₍H₎) − d₁·g₍G₎·y + …,β₍FN₎ = −b₍FN₎·g₍FN₎⁽3⁾ + …Here b₍G₎ > 0 yields an interacting fixed point for gravity; ξ₍c₎ ≡ 1⁄6 is the conformal value; {aᵢ, cᵢ, d₁, b₍FN₎} are scheme-dependent constants of O(1). The ellipses denote higher-order or small gauge/Yukawa dressings (kept in code).
Fixed point. Solving βᵢ = 0 gives
g₍G₎⋆ = 2⁄b₍G₎,
λ₍Φ⋆₎ = (a₁ − √(a₁² − 4a₀a₂))·g₍G₎⋆ ⁄ (2a₀)  (choose the positive, weakly-coupled root),
ξ⋆ = ξ₍c₎, y⋆ = 0, g₍FN⋆₎ = 0.
Thus {g₍G₎, λ₍Φ₎, ξ} sit at a non-Gaussian fixed point; matter Yukawas and FN gauge are irrelevant asymptotically (flow to zero).

K.3 Critical exponents and relevant directions
Linearize βᵢ around g⃗⋆. The stability matrix 𝕄₍ij₎ ≡ ∂βᵢ⁄∂gⱼ|⋆ has eigenvalues −θᵢ. The relevant directions have θᵢ > 0. At leading order:θ₍G₎ ≈ +2  − 4⁄b₍G₎  (> 0 if b₍G₎ > 2),θ₍λξ₎ are the eigenvalues of the 2×2 block in (λ₍Φ₎, ξ − ξ₍c₎); for weak mixing,
θ₍λ₎ ≈ +a₁·g₍G₎⋆ − O(g₍G₎⋆²), θ₍ξ₎ ≈ +c₂·g₍G₎⋆ − c₁·λ₍Φ⋆₎.With generic O(1) coefficients, two relevant directions emerge: one predominantly along g₍G₎, another along a λ–ξ combination. All other couplings (y₍a₎, g₍FN₎) are irrelevant (θ < 0).
Implication. The UV critical surface is two-dimensional. IR physics is then specified by two renormalized constants, which we take as the dynamical scale f and the overlap C₍χ₎ (derived below).

K.4 Dimensional transmutation and the f scale
Use the RG-improved effective potential V₍RG₎(Φ; μ) with μ set to Φ (minimizes logs). At one improvement level
V₍RG₎(Φ) ≈ ¼ λ₍Φ₎(Φ)·Φ⁽4⁾,
and the stationary condition dV⁄dΦ = 0 at Φ = f gives
λ₍Φ₎(f) + ¼ β₍λ₎(f) = 0.  (Coleman–Weinberg condition)
Solving the flow from g⃗⋆ down to f along the two relevant directions yields
f = μ₍UV₎·exp[ − ∫₍g⃗⋆→g⃗(f)₎ dgᵢ · (∂ ln Φ₍min₎⁄∂gᵢ) ],
which we evaluate numerically in the UV pack. Intuitively, the distance from the UV critical surface in the λ–ξ plane sets the transmutation point; f is not an input but a prediction once the two relevant parameters are fixed by matching.

K.5 Wavefunction flows and Z₍ψ,0₎
Let γ₍ψ₎(μ) be the anomalous dimension of a representative matter fermion (or the FN messenger). The running field renormalization is
Z₍ψ₎(μ) = exp[ − ∫⁽μ₎⁽μ₍UV₎⁾ γ₍ψ₎(μ′) d ln μ′ ].
We define Z₍ψ,0₎ ≡ Z₍ψ₎(μ₀) at a lab anchor μ₀ (e.g., 1 GeV). Z₍ψ,0₎ propagates into:the normalization of SM Yukawas at μ₀ (bookkeeping for the one-λ flavor checks),the dilaton overlap C₍χ₎ (below), when matter loops renormalize the trace.Gravitational contributions to γ₍ψ₎ are O(g₍G₎) and hence small at and below f; we include them with a conservative uncertainty band.

K.6 Canonical normalization and C₍χ₎
Write the Φ kinetic term as ½ Z₍Φ₎(μ)(∂Φ)². Define the canonically normalized fluctuation χ₍d₎ by
χ₍d₎ ≡ Z₍Φ₎⁽1⁄2⁾(f) · δΦ  at Φ = f.
Under the Weyl map (Appendix J) the linear coupling to the matter trace is
𝓛 ⊃ (χ₍d₎⁄f)·T₍m₎ × C₍χ₎,  with  C₍χ₎ ≡ Z₍Φ₎⁽−1⁄2⁾(f) · 𝒞₍mix₎(f, ξ(f)).
Here 𝒞₍mix₎ encodes the small ξ-dependent admixture from the curvature term (Φ²R) into the trace and any scheme-fixed improvement. To leading order near ξ ≈ ξ₍c₎,
𝒞₍mix₎ = 1 + α₍mix₎·(ξ − ξ₍c₎) + O((ξ − ξ₍c₎)²),
so the dominant prediction is
C₍χ₎ ≈ Z₍Φ₎⁽−1⁄2⁾(f)  up to small, controlled ξ-shifts.
We compute Z₍Φ₎(f) by integrating the scalar anomalous dimension γ₍Φ₎ along the UV→IR trajectory:
Z₍Φ₎(f) = exp[ − ∫⁽f₎⁽μ₍UV₎⁾ γ₍Φ₎(μ′) d ln μ′ ].
This number, with its RG uncertainty, is what ships in the UV pack.

K.7 The FN module and the one-λ map
Identify the FN flavon with Φ (single-scale option). With an FN cutoff M₍*₎ (messenger scale along the asymptotic-safety flow), the small parameter is
λ ≡ f⁄M₍*₎  (0 < λ < 1).
Assign integer charges q₍a₎ to matter bilinears; the Yukawas at μ₀ obey
y₍a₎(μ₀) ≈ y₍*₎ · Z₍ψ,0₎⁽−1⁄2⁾ · λ⁽q₍a₎⁾ · (1 + δ₍RG₎),
where y₍₎ is an O(1) UV coefficient and δ₍RG₎ collects mild running between f and μ₀. The integer rigidity of q₍a₎ is a discrete hypothesis tested in §12.3 with Bayes factors; λ is not a fit nuisance but computed once f and M₍₎ are determined from the UV flow (next).

K.8 Matching to M₍*₎ and closing the loop
The messenger scale M₍₎ is the energy at which the FN operators are generated. In Track A we tie M₍₎ to the gravitational relevant ray: a convenient and predictive choice is the scale where g₍G₎(μ) crosses a fixed fraction of g₍G₎⋆ (e.g., g₍G₎ = g₍G₎⋆⁄2) and λ₍Φ₎, ξ are within a prescribed small ball around their fixed-point values. This definition is stable and scheme-portable.
Then
λ = f⁄M₍*₎ is predicted by the same two relevant parameters that set f. Integer {q₍a₎} are model-building inputs (frozen before data); together these give the one-λ tests (§12.3).

K.9 Worked mini-example (symbolic numbers; shipped script reproduces)
Choose illustrative coefficients b₍G₎ = 10, a₀ = 6, a₁ = 5, a₂ = 0.6, c₁ = 1, c₂ = 1.g₍G₎⋆ = 0.2.λ₍Φ⋆₎ = (5 − √(25 − 14.4))·0.2⁄12 ≈ 0.013.ξ⋆ = 1⁄6.Integrating down along two relevant rays fixed by {θ₍G₎, θ₍λ₎} yields
f ≈ 10ⁿ μ₀ (n determined by the ray projection),
Z₍Φ₎(f) ≈ 1.21 ⇒ C₍χ₎ ≈ 1⁄√1.21 ≈ 0.91,
M₍*₎ chosen by the crossing rule gives, e.g., λ ≈ 0.22.
Then κ = C₍χ₎⁄f, and the pre-ignition calibration follows:
κ⁽2⁾·Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1⁄[8π(M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾)]  ⇒  fixes Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ once {M, ξ, f, C₍χ₎} are set.
(These numbers are placeholders; the UV pack’s script recomputes them from chosen priors and prints HPDs.)

K.10 Outputs and guardrails (what ships; what would fail)
Outputs. The UV pack includes:Fixed-point g⃗⋆ with stability matrix and exponents {θᵢ}.Trajectory integrals yielding f, M₍*₎, Z₍Φ₎(f), Z₍ψ,0₎, C₍χ₎.Predicted λ = f⁄M₍*₎ and example {q₍a₎} tables for one-λ tests.Uncertainty envelopes from scheme variation and two-loop toggles.Guardrails. We reject parameter corners that would imply:Z₍Φ₎(f) ≤ 0 or C₍χ₎ not real (violates positivity/causality; Appendix I).ξ far from ξ₍c₎ at f, producing large non-minimal imprints (would leak into PPN).β₍λ₎(f) too large in magnitude, spoiling the CW condition (no stable f).λ outside (0,1) or q₍a₎ non-integers (breaks the one-λ semantics).K.11 Contract (takeaway)Two relevant UV directions control everything: flowing down sets a finite f and the overlap C₍χ₎ (mostly Z₍Φ₎⁽−1⁄2⁾(f)).These determine the single lab dial via κ = C₍χ₎⁄f, which fixes the pre-ignition match and powers θ₍G₎(t).The FN piece is a thin veneer: λ = f⁄M₍*₎ is predicted along the same flow, while integers {q₍a₎} supply rigid exponents for flavor tests.All steps respect the EFT guardrails (positivity, unitarity, gauge neutrality); any breach quarantines the model before it touches the lab fits.Track A thus furnishes a compact UV→IR pipeline: {β’s, θ’s} → {f, Z₍Φ₎(f)} → {C₍χ₎, κ} → calibration, while the FN veneer maps {f, M₍*₎} → λ for independent, quantitative cross-checks.

L. UV details Track B: AdS dictionary; operator dimensions; overlap for C₍χ₎
Aim. Give a clean AdS/CFT route (Track B) that (i) maps bulk fields ↔ CFT operators, (ii) identifies the radion⁄dilaton as χ₍d₎, (iii) computes the normalization C₍χ₎ from a bulk–matter overlap, and (iv) explains why flavor exponents obey q = Δ − 1 (with integers enforced by a discrete veneer). The lab-facing dial remains κ ≡ C₍χ₎⁄f, feeding G₍eff₎(t) = κ⁽2⁾ Ī(t)⁄c₍χ₎ and the pre-ignition calibration in §J.3.

L.1 AdS setup (geometry and bookkeeping)Background. A five-dimensional slice of AdS with curvature scale k ≡ 1⁄L, metric
ds² = (L²⁄z²)·(η₍μν₎ dx⁽μ₎ dx⁽ν₎ + dz²),  with z ∈ [ε, z₍IR₎].
The UV brane sits at z = ε ≪ L, the IR brane at z = z₍IR₎. The warp factor w ≡ ε⁄z₍IR₎ ≪ 1 sets the IR scale Λ₍IR₎ ∼ w·Λ₍UV₎.Gravity. 4D M is fixed by M₍5₎ and L: M⁽2⁾ ≈ M₍5₎³ L·(1 − w²). We work in the 4D Einstein frame (Appendix J).

Matter. SM fields may live on the UV brane, the IR brane, or in the bulk with profiles p₍X₎(z). Choices only change the overlap C₍χ₎, not the logic.

L.2 Operator dictionary (Δ ↔ m² and near-boundary data)

Bulk scalar ϕ ↔ CFT operator 𝒪. Mass–dimension relation: m²L² = Δ(Δ − 4) with Δ ≥ 1 the 4D scaling dimension.Near-boundary expansion. ϕ(x,z) → A(x)·z⁽4−Δ⁾ + B(x)·z⁽Δ⁾. A(x) sources 𝒪, B(x) ∝ ⟨𝒪⟩.Trace operator. The CFT trace T⁽μ⁾₍μ₎ couples to the radion⁄dilaton degree of freedom that modulates the IR position; χ₍d₎ is the 4D Goldstone of broken dilatations (with small mass if stabilized). Its linear coupling is the trace portal χ₍d₎·T₍m₎ (Appendix J).L.3 Radion⁄dilaton mode and its decay constant fMode. The radion r(x) parameterizes fluctuations of z₍IR₎ (or the inter-brane distance). After mixing removal and canonical normalization, χ₍d₎ ≡ r with kinetic term ½(∂χ₍d₎)².Decay constant. f controls the Weyl factor Ω(χ₍d₎) ≈ exp(χ₍d₎⁄f). In RS-like stabilizations,
f ≈ α₍r₎ · (M₍5₎³ L)⁽1⁄2⁾ · w,  with α₍r₎ an O(1) geometry factor.
Thus f is naturally at the IR scale, set by the warp factor (dimensional transmutation on the CFT side).L.4 Overlap formula for C₍χ₎ (bulk integral)
C₍χ₎ measures how strongly χ₍d₎ couples to the matter trace that lives in the bulk⁄branes. Let ψ₍χ₎(z) be the properly normalized radion wavefunction and w₍m₎(z) the matter trace weight (including metric factors and field profiles). Then
C₍χ₎ = 𝒩 · ∫₍ε₎⁽z₍IR₎⁾ dz · (L⁄z)³ · ψ₍χ₎(z) · w₍m₎(z),
with 𝒩 a scheme-stable normalization chosen so that χ₍d₎⁄f · T₍m₎ reproduces the 4D trace portal. Three useful limits:UV-brane matter. w₍m₎(z) ∝ δ(z − ε). Then C₍χ₎ ∝ ψ₍χ₎(ε) ∼ w² (UV suppression).IR-brane matter. w₍m₎(z) ∝ δ(z − z₍IR₎). Then C₍χ₎ ∝ ψ₍χ₎(z₍IR₎) = O(1).Bulk matter (fermion with localization c). w₍m₎(z) ∝ (L⁄z)⁴ · z⁽1−2c⁾ for a left zero-mode. Then C₍χ₎ ∝ ∫ dz z⁽−3−2c⁾ ψ₍χ₎(z), yielding exponential hierarchies as c varies.In all cases κ ≡ C₍χ₎⁄f is the only lab-facing combination entering G₍eff₎(t).

L.5 Flavor exponents from dimensions: q = Δ − 1 (and integers)
On the CFT side, a Yukawa arises from a higher-dimension operator suppressed by Λ₍IR₎, e.g., 𝒪₁ 𝒪₂ H with dim Δ = Δ₁ + Δ₂ + Δ₍H₎. Matching to 4D gives
y ∼ (Λ₍IR₎⁄Λ₍UV₎)⁽Δ−4⁾ = w⁽Δ−4⁾.
Identifying λ ≡ w and absorbing Higgs engineering leaves
y ∼ λ⁽q⁾ with  q = Δ − 1.
To enforce integer q we add a thin discrete veneer (e.g., Zₙ charge assignments) that (i) restricts allowed operator dimensions to an integer lattice, (ii) aligns with bulk orbifold parities, and (iii) is frozen pre-analysis. This implements the one-λ structure with integer {q₍a₎} used in §12.3.

L.6 Pre-ignition calibration and Planck matchingPlanck map. M⁽2⁾ = M₍5₎³ L·(1 − w²) sets the 4D Einstein term.Weyl map. The non-minimal JF piece yields M²₍eff₎ = M⁽2⁾ + ξ f⁽2⁾ (Appendix J).Calibration. As in §J.3,
κ⁽2⁾ · Ī₍0₎⁄c₍χ₎ = 1 ⁄ [8π · M²₍eff₎].
Here κ = C₍χ₎⁄f with C₍χ₎ from the overlap above and f from §L.3. Once fixed, only θ₍G₎(t) moves.L.7 Spectrum, two-point functions, and guardrailsUnitarity bound. Δ ≥ 1; the radion admixture corresponds to the marginal direction of broken dilatations.2-point of 𝒪. ⟨𝒪𝒪⟩(p) ∝ p⁽2Δ−4⁾; the spectral density is positive. No extra light scalars are allowed in the IR besides χ₍d₎, or else composition tests would light up.No metric back-door. The 4D graviton kinetic term is untouched; χ₍d₎ appears only through the trace portal. PPN and GW guardrails remain those of Appendix D.Subluminality. Bulk causality ↔ boundary microcausality ensures χ-fronts respect c₍χ₎ ≤ 1; our lag geometry in §G would refute any violation.L.8 What sets C₍χ₎ numerically (practical handles)Geometry. ψ₍χ₎(z) is sharply IR-peaked; its normalization fixes an O(1) factor.Localization. Moving SM fields toward the UV exponentially suppresses C₍χ₎; pushing them IR makes C₍χ₎ O(1).Stabilization. Goldberger–Wise parameters slightly distort ψ₍χ₎(z); we carry this as a prior band and propagate to C₍χ₎ HPDs.Running veneer. Small RG dressing from bulk loops is included as a multiplicative nuisance ≤ O(10⁻¹).All ingredients are pre-registered in the UV pack (profiles, priors, and scripts).

L.9 Outputs and failure modes (what ships)
Outputs. The Track B pack includes:Operator set with dimensions {Δ₍a₎} and the q = Δ − 1 map for flavor tests.Radion normalization: f with HPD, ψ₍χ₎(z) tabulation, and α₍r₎.Overlap integrals for three placements (UV, IR, bulk–c) and the resulting C₍χ₎ with uncertainties.κ = C₍χ₎⁄f and the pre-ignition calibration check (hashes).Failure modes. We quarantine choices that imply:Extra light scalars besides χ₍d₎ at the IR scale (fifth-force risk).Large UV localization yielding C₍χ₎ ≪ 10⁻³ unless compensated—would underpower κ against calibration.Any need for non-Weyl metric couplings (χ₍d₎·R) at lab scales (would leak into PPN).L.10 Contract (takeaway)The radion⁄dilaton of a warped AdS slice is χ₍d₎ with decay constant f fixed by geometry; its linear coupling to matter is the trace portal.The coupling C₍χ₎ is a bulk overlap determined by the radion wavefunction and matter profiles; κ = C₍χ₎⁄f is what the lab sees.Flavor follows a one-parameter law y ∼ λ⁽q⁾ with q = Δ − 1 and λ = w; integers are enforced by a thin discrete veneer fixed in advance.All guardrails (PPN, GW, positivity, subluminality) stay green, and the UV pack ships computable {f, C₍χ₎, λ, q} with uncertainties—closing the Track B loop from geometry and CFT data to the single dial θ₍G₎(t).M. Preregistration artifacts: Nexus Ops Card; Ignition Ledger; instrument configs; templates
Aim. Freeze every decision before data-taking: who/what/when/how ignition is declared; how instruments are configured; how lags, anisotropy, and steps are fit; how hashes and nulls are recorded. This appendix supplies drop-in templates you can mint (unchanged) as DOIs.

M.1 Purpose & scope (what is fixed pre-run)Ignition rules (first-hit semantics): the first t with N(t) ≥ N₍c₎, J₍eff₎(t) ≥ J₍c₎, and C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎ is t₍ign₎ (no post-hoc tuning).One-dial control: all controllables enter via 𝒜(t,Ω); analysis exposes only θ₍G₎(t) = Ī(t)/Ī₍0₎.Guardrails: PPN/GW neutrality; EM-drift null; positivity/unitarity; subluminality; cosmology neutrality; composition null.Receipts: every artifact (data, code, configs) ships with SHA-256 hashes.M.2 Nexus Ops Card (preregistered operations)
Role. Defines the Nexus membership, windows, witnesses, thresholds, and independence audits used to compute J₍c₎ and N₍c₎ (fixed to 25 by the calibration arithmetic in Appendix C).
M.2.1 Fields (human-readable)Membership & windows. N₍c₎ = 25; active window (t₀, t₀+τ); allowable dropouts ≤ p₍drop,max₎.Witness stack. Asynchronous W₍N₎ with separable bound B₍N₎; axes RNG seed; min depth; p-value floor.Superposition metric. 𝒞₍k₎ threshold per member; rolling audit of ⟨𝒞₍k₎⟩.Drive constants. j₍0₎ (single-member scale), m₍*₎ (order-parameter floor), ζ (safety factor), J₍c₎ (fold threshold), τ₍sh₎ (shoulder), A₍sh₎ (amplitude prior).QND capacity. C₍QND₎(τ) method (Fisher/QFI lower bound), floor C₍*₎, device and cadence.Independence. Physical separation, comms blackout, audit beacons, RNG attestations, cross-member correlation ceiling.Ethics & privacy. De-identification, consent, revocation path, DPIA link.Timebase. UTC, GPS-PPS, PTP; drift ceilings; site clock offsets.M.2.2 Machine-readable card (YAML template)

ANI pack: τ̂₍A₎, OU PSD overlays, residual diagnostics.
ODF pack: S₍y,i₎(f), C₁₂(f), γ²(f), taper specs, bands.
CFG pack: all site configs (this appendix templates, filled).
LEDGER: the JSON ledger (M.3.2), immutable.Hashes. Every pack includes SHA-256; the Ledger repeats them.Versioning. Semantic version tags; any change → new DOI (old artifacts frozen).M.7 Ethics, privacy, and independence attestationDe-identification. Nexus IDs are salted hashes; no raw personal data in public packs.Consent. Protocol and withdrawal path included in Ops Card.Independence. Physical separation, comms blackout, RNG attestations, and correlation ceilings are logged; any breach invalidates t₍ign₎ for claims.Transparency. All preregistered numbers (N₍c₎ = 25, J₍c₎, j₍0₎, m₍₎, ζ, C₍₎, τ windows) appear in the Ops Card before data start.M.8 Contract (what these artifacts guarantee)Ignition is a first-hit event keyed to (N₍c₎, J₍c₎, C₍QND₎) with zero after-the-fact tuning.Analysis is a frozen pipeline: same PSDs, same lags, same cone tests, same priors.Reproducibility: third parties can re-compute θ₍G₎(t), lags, and c₍χ₎ bounds from packs + hashes.Guardrails are auditable: any violation (PPN/GW, EM-drift, composition, subluminality) is visible in the receipts and blocks a claim.N. Global-fit math & code notes; model selection; reproducibility checklist
Aim. Specify (i) the statistical models and likelihoods used to infer the dial θ₍G₎(t) and nuisance fields, (ii) model-selection logic (nulls, foils, alternatives), (iii) coding and numerical hygiene needed for deterministic replication, and (iv) the step-by-step checklist a third party follows to reproduce all figures and claims.

N.1 Data model (sites, channels, timebase)Sites. i ∈ {1,…,S} with site gain a₍i₎ and latency Δt₍i₎.Observable. y₍i₎(t) = a₍i₎·θ₍G₎(t − Δt₍i₎) + u₍i₎(t) + ϵ₍i₎(t).Latent dial. θ₍G₎(t) = 1 + k₍sh₎(t − t₍ign₎) + s₍A₎(t).
k₍sh₎(t) = A₍sh₎·e⁽−t⁄τ₍sh₎⁾·Θ(t); s₍A₎ is OU with τ₍A₎.Site noise. u₍i₎ OU(τ₍c,i₎, σ₍c,i₎); ϵ₍i₎ white⁄colored per device.Front geometry. Δt₍i₎ satisfy a planar-front constraint with v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ (used in lag fusion).Cadence is uniform after resampling to Δ (prewhiten ENV notches as preregistered).

N.2 Likelihoods and priors
N.2.1 State-space (time domain, primary)
Discretize with step Δ:Latent. s₍A₎⁽k+1⁾ = ϕ₍A₎·s₍A₎⁽k⁾ + η⁽k⁾, ϕ₍A₎ = e⁽−Δ⁄τ₍A₎⁾, η ∼ 𝓝(0,q₍A₎).
θ₍G₎⁽k⁾ = 1 + s₍A₎⁽k⁾ + A₍sh₎·e⁽−(t₍k₎−t₍ign₎)⁄τ₍sh₎⁾·Θ(·).Sites. y₍i₎⁽k⁾ = a₍i₎·θ₍G₎⁽k−ℓᵢ⁾ + u₍i₎⁽k⁾ + ε₍i⁾⁽k⁾;
u₍i₎⁽k+1⁾ = ϕ₍c,i₎·u₍i₎⁽k⁾ + ξ₍i⁾⁽k⁾.Likelihood. Gaussian conditionals implied by the linear-Gaussian SSM. Evaluate via Kalman filter; optimize (EM) to MLE, then refine with MCMC on Θ.
Priors (weakly informative).
A₍sh₎ ∼ 𝓝(0, σ²=0.05²); log τ₍sh₎ ∼ 𝓝(log 1 d, 0.5²);
log τ₍A₎ ∼ 𝓝(log 30 d, 1²); a₍i₎ ∼ 𝓝(1, 0.3²);
log τ₍c,i₎ ∼ 𝓝(log 1 h, 1²); σ’s half-Cauchy(0, 0.05).
t₍ign₎ is fixed by the Ledger (Appendix M); ℓᵢ = round(Δt₍i₎⁄Δ) with Δt₍i₎ treated below.
N.2.2 Spectral (cross-check)
Whittle likelihood on tapered periodograms for bands 𝔅:
S₍y,i₎(f) ≈ a²₍i₎[ |K₍sh₎(f)|² + S₍A₎(f) ] + S₍u,i₎(f) + S₍ε,i₎(f).
Jointly fit across sites; priors as above. Used only to validate time-domain inferences.
N.2.3 Lag submodel
Cross-phase regression in a coherence-selected band (γ² ≥ γ²₍min₎) gives Δt̂₁₂ with Gaussian errors; matched-filter onsets give independent Δt̃’s. Fuse both with a planar-front geometry to infer n̂₍front₎ and v₍front₎, then set a truncated prior c₍χ₎ ≥ v₍front₎ with c₍χ₎ ≤ 1 hard. Report c₍χ₎ 95% bound.

N.3 Models compared (selection)M₀ (null). No ignition: A₍sh₎ = 0; OU only.M₁ (shoulder only). A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ free; no anisotropy (σ₍A₎ = 0).M₂ (shoulder + anisotropy). Full model: {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, σ₍A₎}.M₍⊙foil₎ (Sun-locked γ-foil). Add a small deterministic term θ₍G,⊙₎(t) = 1 − ε·f(r/R₍⊙sink₎); ε prior centered at 0 with tight σ.
All models share site-noise structure and cone constraints.Evidence & criteria. Compute log p(y|M) via bridge/thermo integration or PSIS-LOO; report Bayes factors B₍ij₎ and LOO/WAIC deltas. Decision rule (§16): claim requires M₂ ≻ M₁ ≻ M₀ with preregistered thresholds and all guardrails green.

N.4 Identification & regularizationShoulder vs OU leakage. Enforce orthogonality by excluding f ≪ 1⁄τ₍sh₎ from the phase-slope band and using prior shrinkage on σ₍A₎.Gain–amplitude confounding. Center θ̂₍G₎ around 1 and impose a hierarchical prior a₍i₎ ∼ 𝓝(ā, σₐ²) with weak group shrinkage.Arrival alignment. Treat Δt₍i₎ as nuisance with Gaussian priors from the lag pipeline (Appendix G); propagate to Θ via joint sampling.Missing data & outliers. Kalman formulation naturally handles gaps; apply 4σ clipping on residuals as in configs.N.5 Inference workflow (deterministic)Hash check. Verify SHA-256 of all packs (LEDGER, LAG, ANI, ODF, CFG).Env freeze. Create environment (see N.6) and record pip freeze / conda env export.Preprocess. Apply preregistered filters and resampling; lock RNG seeds (Appendix M).Lag fit. Run spectral + matched-filter pipelines; save Δt̂, HPDs, cone plots; compute c₍χ₎ bound.State-space fit. EM to MLE; initialize MCMC (e.g., NUTS) at MLE; sample until \hat{R} ≤ 1.01, ESS ≥ 400 per parameter.Model selection. Compute PSIS-LOO/WAIC; optionally nested sampling to cross-check evidence.Posterior predictive checks. Simulate ỹ under posterior; compare PSDs, autocovariances, step-onset histograms.Receipts. Write JSON summaries with medians, HPDs, diagnostics; re-hash outputs; update the Ledger mirror.N.6 Code notes (stack, numerics, seeds)Languages. Reference implementation in Python; mirror notebooks in Julia⁄R optional.Packages (pin versions). numpy, scipy, numba, matplotlib, xarray; SSM via pykalman or custom JAX; MCMC via numpyro⁄pymc (NUTS), or stan.Linear algebra. Use stabilized Kalman (Joseph form); square-root filters for long τ₍A₎. PSDs computed with multitaper (K ≥ 3).Randomness. Single master seed per run; record in Ledger.Tolerance. Cholesky jitter 1e−9; clip |ϕ| ≤ 0.999999 for OU AR(1) equivalents.Performance. Chunk by day; vectorize per site; avoid FFT leakage (tapers + zero-pads).(In code/JSON use ASCII subscripts: e.g., tau_A_s, A_sh.)

N.7 Reporting fields (what ships)θ₍G₎ pack. {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, a₍i₎} posteriors; θ̂₍G₎(t) series; residuals; PPC plots.Lag pack. Δt̂’s with errors; v̂₍front₎ HPD; c₍χ₎ bound; cone checks.Selection pack. LOO table, WAIC, Bayes factors, model ranks.Diagnostics. \hat{R}, ESS, energy/BFMI, divergences (zero), autocorr lengths.Seeds & hashes. RNG seeds; env hash; code commit; data pack hashes.N.8 Reproducibility checklist (third-party)Download all packs + templates; verify hashes match Ledger.Create env from environment.yml (or requirements.txt); record solver output.Run 00_precheck.ipynb: confirm timebase alignment and filter coefficients.Run 10_lag.ipynb: compute Δt̂, v̂₍front₎, c₍χ₎; verify cone plots; compare to Ledger.Run 20_state_space.ipynb: reproduce {A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, a₍i₎}; check diagnostics.Run 30_model_selection.ipynb: reproduce LOO/WAIC/Bayes factors.Run 40_ppc.ipynb: posterior predictive overlays; confirm acceptance criteria.Export receipts (*-receipt.json); recompute hashes; confirm equality with Ledger fields.Sign off: produce a 1-page replication statement with the five key numbers (A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎, τ₍A₎, v̂₍front₎, c₍χ₎ bound) and attach figures.N.9 Failure modes & quarantine rulesDiagnostics fail. Any \hat{R} > 1.01 or ESS < 200 → rerun with longer chains; persistent failure quarantines the claim.Cone breach. Any pre-cone violation or v̂₍front₎ > 1 within HPD → reject.Selection weak. Bayes factor thresholds not met (M₂ vs M₁ or M₀) → no claim.Guardrail trip. Any PPN⁄GW, EM-drift, composition, or cosmology neutrality check fails → hard stop (§15.3).Sensitivity gap. Posterior on A₍sh₎ consistent with 0 and power analysis says underpowered → null reported with updated bounds.N.10 Contract (takeaway)
This appendix fixes the math, software and procedures that convert raw multi-site time series into the dial θ₍G₎(t), lags, and c₍χ₎ bounds; it pre-commits the model comparison that adjudicates signals; and it supplies a turn-key checklist that an independent group can run to reproduce the numbers and hashes printed in the Ledger.

O. Adamas 1D — Minimal Theory, Spec, and Lab Protocols (SSH-like model; Raman/strain tests; JSON schema; universality ratio; falsification)
Scope. A compact, falsifiable package for a one-dimensional carbon line (Adamas 1D) modeled as a dimerizable π-chain (Peierls/SSH). You get: (i) a minimal Hamiltonian and strain map, (ii) tight predictions for Raman and transport, (iii) turnkey lab protocols, (iv) a JSON schema for data, and (v) universality ratios that must hold across devices or the hypothesis is rejected.

O.1 Minimal theory (SSH-like model with Peierls dimerization)
Lattice & DOFs. A single carbon chain with alternating bonds (…C=C–C=C…); two-site unit cell (A,B). Nearest-neighbor π hopping with dimerization.
Hamiltonian (1D, momentum k).
Energies in eV; set ℏ = 1 in derivations, restore as needed.Bloch form:  H(k) = d₍x₎(k)·σ₍x₎ + d₍y₎(k)·σ₍y₎,  with
d₍x₎ = t̄·(1 + r) + t̄·(1 − r)·cos(k a),
d₍y₎ = t̄·(1 − r)·sin(k a).Parameters: t̄ is the average hopping; r ∈ (−1,1) is the dimerization ratio (r = 0 uniform; r ≠ 0 Peierls). Lattice spacing a is the undistorted A–B separation.Gap and edge physics.Band gap: Δ = 2·|d(k = π⁄a)| = 2·t̄·|r|.Edge zero mode: for open boundaries and r > 0 (topological phase), a mid-gap state localizes at the edge with length ξ = v₍F₎⁄Δ (v₍F₎ the Fermi velocity at r → 0).Strain map.Uniaxial strain ε modifies hoppings via a Grüneisen-like law: t → t·exp(−β·ε₍bond₎). For alternating bonds, ε toggles signs in the dimerization channel. To leading order:
r(ε) ≈ r₍0₎ + α·ε, t̄(ε) ≈ t̄₍0₎·(1 − γ·ε),
with α (electron–phonon), γ (overall Grüneisen) as device-level constants.Phonon (BOW) mode.The bond-order-wave (BOW) optical mode (zone center) is the Raman-active dimerization oscillator with frequency ω₍BOW₎. In mean-field Peierls theory near criticality (|r| ≪ 1): ω₍BOW₎ ∝ |r|⁽1⁄2⁾ (softens as r → 0).O.2 Compact predictions to testGap–strain slope.
dΔ/dε = 2·t̄₍0₎·(α − γ·r₍0₎) + O(ε). Sign and magnitude fixed per device after one calibration point.Edge-length law.
ξ(ε) = v₍F₎(ε)⁄Δ(ε). Hence the product
Υ ≡ Δ·ξ⁄(ℏ v₍F₎) → 1  (within ±0.15 once v₍F₎ renormalization is included).
Measure Δ by transport⁄STS; measure ξ by STM decay of the edge mode.Raman–gap scaling (soft mode).
Near small |r|: ω₍BOW₎ ∝ |r|⁽1⁄2⁾ and Δ ∝ |r| ⇒
𝕌 ≡ d ln ω₍BOW₎ / d ln Δ → 1⁄2  (universal, geometry-independent; tolerance ±0.1).Topo switch under sign change of r.
If strain can tune r across 0 at fixed terminations, the end state appears⁄disappears with a single sign flip in the Zak phase. Operational signature: mid-gap STS peak toggles with ε around ε₍c₎ where Δ(ε₍c₎) ≈ 0 (device-safe approach uses gated closure, not full zero).Raman doublet control.
Dimerization splits the G-like optical feature into a doublet with separation scaling ~Δ⁽1⁄2⁾; strain sweeps both center and splitting. The low-f tail shows OU-like noise only from environment; no extra narrow lines are permitted.O.3 Device and environment specification (minimal, enforceable)
Geometry & materials.Chain length L ≥ 50 nm (≥ 200 unit cells) to resolve ξ across gap range.Terminations: sp² end-caps or metal–carbon σ clamps; identical ends to avoid trivial asymmetry.Substrate/encapsulation: hBN top⁄bottom (≥ 10 nm); inert atmosphere glovebox assembly.Contacts & gating.Source–drain: Pd or Au with graphene interlayers to reduce sp³ damage.Back gate through 285 nm SiO₂ or dual-hBN stack; gate leakage < 10⁻¹² A at 5 V.Environment.T ≤ 20 K for transport/STS (thermal gap broadening small vs Δ).UHV < 1e⁻¹⁰ mbar for STS; Raman may run at ambient with N₂ purge.Static strain stage with in-plane ε control ±2% and resolution 10⁻⁴.Calibration.Strain from in-situ fiducials (nano-marker spacing) and piezo reading (two-channel cross-calibration).Raman spectrometer resolution ≤ 0.5 cm⁻¹; absolute calibration via Si 520 cm⁻¹ line.O.4 Lab protocols
O.4.1 PreparationAssemble stack (hBN/Adamas/hBN) with dry transfer; align chain along strain axis.Pattern clamps and electrodes by e-beam, low-damage evaporation.Anneal 200–300 °C in forming gas; verify continuity by 2-terminal I–V (ohmic at high T).O.4.2 Strain calibration

Step ε in increments of 2×10⁻⁴ within (−0.5%, +0.5%).

At each ε: image fiducials; update ε from optical metrology; log piezo reading.

O.4.3 Raman (BOW mode)

Laser 532 or 633 nm, power < 200 µW on spot, NA ~ 0.7.

Collect Stokes spectra 100–3000 cm⁻¹; integrate ≥ 60 s; three repeats.

Fit BOW line(s) with Voigt; extract ω₍BOW₎(ε), linewidth, doublet split if present.

O.4.4 Transport (gap)

4-wire if possible; sweep gate V₍g₎ at fixed T ∈ {20, 40, 80, 120 K}.

Extract Δ from Arrhenius of minimum conductance: G₍min₎(T) ∝ exp(−Δ⁄2k₍B₎T).

Cross-check with bias spectroscopy (Coulomb-free window preferred via long chain).

O.4.5 STS (edge mode & ξ)

Park tip at chain end; measure dI/dV maps along chain.

Fit mid-gap resonance decay: A(x) ∝ exp(−x⁄ξ); derive ξ(ε).

Verify mid-gap energy pinned within ±0.1·Δ.

O.4.6 Data fusion & parameters

From Raman and transport: compute 𝕌 = d ln ω₍BOW₎ / d ln Δ via local linear fit across ε window.

From STS and Δ: compute Υ = Δ·ξ⁄(ℏ v₍F₎). Estimate v₍F₎ from band curvature at r → 0 (or adopt v₍F₎ ≈ 8×10⁵ m/s with ±20% prior and refine from dispersion if ARPES-like data exist).

Fit the SSH pair (t̄₍0₎, r₍0₎) and strain coefficients (α, γ) by least squares to Δ(ε) and ω₍BOW₎(ε).

O.6 Universality ratios and acceptance windows

Raman–gap scaling (𝕌). Prediction 𝕌 ≈ 1⁄2 near small |r|; accept if 𝕌 ∈ [0.4, 0.6] across at least three ε windows; reject if 𝕌 consistently outside [0.3, 0.7] with proper error bars.

Edge product (Υ). Prediction Υ → 1; accept if Υ HPD hits [0.8, 1.2]; reject if Υ < 0.6 or > 1.4 after v₍F₎ refinement.

Topo toggle. If gating⁄strain crosses Δ minimum, the edge mid-gap STS peak must diminish/vanish when entering the trivial side and reappear when returning (no hysteresis beyond contact drift). Failure to toggle under clean control rejects topological SSH semantics for the device.

O.7 Falsification & foils
Hard falsifiers.

No measurable Δ at low T and no BOW Raman feature across ε (rules out Peierls/SSH).

𝕌 far from 1⁄2 with stable signals and verified strain (rules out the soft-mode scaling).

Υ far from 1 after v₍F₎ calibration (rules out ξ ∝ 1⁄Δ edge physics).

No edge state at all in long, clean chains (rules out topology or indicates different terminations/chemistry).

Soft foils to test.

Polyyne vs cumulene mix. Two-phase segments give Raman multi-peaks; treat as composition foil.

Electron–phonon nonlinearity. If ω₍BOW₎ ∝ |r|⁽ν₎ with ν ≠ 1⁄2, report ν with errors; repeated ν ≈ 1 implies different mechanism (reject SSH minimality).

Defect pinning. Static disorder may pin r, producing weak Δ(ε) slope; declare as underpowered if Raman linewidths indicate strong inhomogeneity.

O.8 Notes on consistency with Gravastar program
Adamas 1D is materials-local and orthogonal to the χ-dial: it neither modifies metric propagation nor the θ₍G₎ analysis. Its value here is as a clean, falsifiable condensed-matter testbed for coherence-transport ideas. No guardrail in §§15–N is endangered by these experiments.

O.9 Contract (what this appendix buys)

A single-parameter SSH-like minimal theory mapping strain → {Δ, ω₍BOW₎, ξ}.

Two universality ratios (𝕌, Υ) that collapse sample idiosyncrasies and force clear pass/fail outcomes.

Detailed specs and protocols to acquire the necessary Raman, transport, and STS data.

A machine-readable JSON schema so results can be packed, hashed, and reanalyzed.

If these predictions survive across independent labs, Adamas 1D earns its role as a canonical 1D coherence conduit; if not, the minimal story is cleanly falsified and we iterate with the richer (but more fragile) models.

P. Blueprint calculus (optional veneer): B(t,Ω), read operator ℛ(·), single-dial equivalence via 𝒜(t,Ω)
Purpose. Offer a clean, optional layer that (i) encodes any boundary manipulation as a blueprint field B(t,Ω), (ii) formalizes what instruments “see” via a read operator ℛ(·), and (iii) proves single-dial equivalence: to leading order the lab is sensitive only to the monopole of the boundary control 𝒜(t,Ω), i.e., θ₍G₎(t). This veneer does not alter transport, guardrails, or claims; it is bookkeeping that keeps pre-registered control and readout strictly separated.

P.1 Objects and spaces

Blueprint. B(t,Ω) ∈ ℬ, a bounded, nonnegative field on time×sky that encodes intent (what the controller tries to write at the χ boundary). Units: intensity-rate.

Controller. 𝒞: ℬ → 𝒜, a causal map producing the applied boundary control 𝒜(t,Ω) used in §5.2.

Boundary condition (from §5.2). n̂·F − c₍χ₎ u = J₍anc₎ − 𝒜(t,Ω).

Sky basis. Use real spherical harmonics Yₗₘ(Ω). Define monopole projector Π₀[φ] ≡ (1⁄4π)∮ φ(Ω) dΩ.

Read operator (per channel i). ℛᵢ[·]: maps θ₍G₎ and low-rank anisotropy to the observed stream yᵢ(t) after instrument response and noise (Appendix G, N).

Latent dial. θ₍G₎(t) ≡ Ī(t)/Ī₍0₎ with Ī(t) ≡ (c₍χ₎⁄4π)∮ u₍0₎(t,Ω) dΩ.

P.2 Axioms (blueprint→control→physics)
A1 Causality. 𝒞 is causal and Lipschitz on compacts: support(𝒞[B])(t) ⊆ (−∞, t].
A2 Monotonicity. If B₁ ≥ B₂ pointwise then 𝒞[B₁] ≥ 𝒞[B₂].
A3 Capacity gate. 𝒞B = 0 unless the Nexus triplet holds at t: N(t) ≥ 25, J₍eff₎(t) ≥ J₍c₎, C₍QND₎(τ) ≥ C₍*₎ (Appendix M).
A4 Budget. ∮ 𝒞B dΩ ≤ ∮ B(t,Ω) dΩ (no gain creation at the boundary).
A5 Transport closure. Given 𝒞[B] ≡ 𝒜, u₍0₎ and F satisfy the near-isotropic χ transport of §3 with the boundary condition above.

P.3 Single-dial equivalence class
Define an equivalence relation on boundary controls:
𝒜₁ ~ 𝒜₂ iff Π₀[𝒜₁(t,·)] = Π₀[𝒜₂(t,·)] for all t.

Quotient. The lab-relevant class is [𝒜] ∈ 𝒜⁄ker(Π₀). All non-monopole components (l ≥ 1) propagate as bounded nuisances (A₍1₎, A₍tri₎) per §§3.5, 4.4, G.

Dial map. θ₍G₎(t) = 1 − c₀·Π₀[𝒜(t,·)] with c₀ ≡ (1⁄Ī₍0₎) under the weak-sink linearization used in §4 (shadowing law). Any two controls with the same Π₀ are operationally identical at leading order.

P.4 Blueprint→control: practical projector
In preregistered ops we choose 𝒞 as a budget-respecting projector onto an admissible set 𝒮 of smooth, low-rank sky patterns:

Filter. B ↦ B⁽adm⁾ by convolving on S² with a bandwidth-l kernel (e.g., l ≤ 2).

Clamp. Enforce bounds 0 ≤ B⁽adm⁾ ≤ B₍max₎(t) pointwise.

Gate. Multiply by the Nexus gate 𝒢(t) ∈ {0,1} (A3).

Return. 𝒞[B] ≡ 𝒜 = B⁽adm⁾·𝒢.

This makes Π₀[𝒜] a stable functional of B and pins the nuisance subspace to l ≤ 2 so A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ are controlled (§§3.4–3.5).

P.5 Read operator ℛ(·) (what instruments see)
Write each channel i as
yᵢ(t) = hᵢ ⋆ { aᵢ·θ₍G₎(t − Δtᵢ) + ∑ₗₘ bᵢ,ₗₘ·Aₗₘ(t − Δtᵢ) } + nᵢ(t),
where:
hᵢ is the instrument impulse response, aᵢ a gain, Δtᵢ a latency (Appendix G), and Aₗₘ(t) the l ≥ 1 harmonics of 𝒜 transported to the boundary intensity u₍0₎. Define ℛᵢ by:
ℛᵢ𝒜 ≡ hᵢ ⋆ { aᵢ·[1 − c₀·Π₀(𝒜)] + ∑ₗₘ bᵢ,ₗₘ·Aₗₘ }(t).
Identification. The monopole term is what drives A₍sh₎, τ₍sh₎ fits; harmonics feed the anisotropy OU block (τ₍A₎) and the tri-lobe templates (Appendix G, N).

P.6 Energy and invariants

Intensity balance. δĪ(t) ≡ Ī₍0₎[θ₍G₎(t) − 1] = − c₁·Π₀[𝒜(t,·)] with c₁ fixed by §4 calibration.

Nonnegativity. θ₍G₎(t) ≥ 0 by A2–A4 and weak-sink linearization.

Causal envelope. Changes in ℛᵢ obey t-ordering consistent with v₍front₎ ≤ c₍χ₎ (Appendix G): arrivals respect the cone.

P.7 Two canonical blueprints (for intuition)Ignition patch. B₍ign₎(t,Ω) = S(t)·S₍Ω₀₎(Ω), where S(t) is a step gated by the Nexus and S₍Ω₀₎ is a small cap around Ω₀. After 𝒞, Π₀[𝒜] ≈ const×area(cap)×S(t). Outcome: a clean shoulder with amplitude A₍sh₎ and timescale τ₍sh₎.

Solar foil. B₍⊙₎(t,Ω) = ε·S₍⊙₎(Ω − Ω₍⊙₎(t)). Π₀[𝒜] = 0 to first order; only l ≥ 1 leak through as a bounded nuisance ∝ ε. This isolates γ = 0 default unless data demand ε ≠ 0 (§7.2, §14.2).

P.8 Identifiability and the quotient view

Quotienting nuisances. Because claims depend only on Π₀[𝒜], we quotient out ker(Π₀). Fits reconstruct θ₍G₎(t) from ℛᵢ up to l ≥ 1 components, which are profiled as nuisances with priors from §3.5 and Appendix G.

When anisotropy matters. If A₍1₎, A₍tri₎ saturate priors, model selection falls back to M₁ or M₀ (§N.3) and no claim is issued.

P.10 Contract (what this veneer guarantees)Any admissible blueprint B(t,Ω) collapses, for lab purposes, to one number over time: Π₀[𝒜(t,·)], hence θ₍G₎(t).

All non-monopole content is quarantined as low-rank nuisances (A₍1₎, A₍tri₎) with pre-registered priors and OU decay.

The read operator ℛ cleanly separates physics from instrument response; it is linear, causal, and shares the same seeds and hashes used in the Ledger.

Nothing here modifies transport, GR guardrails, or claims; it is a transparent, optional calculus that documents how a planned boundary action becomes the single dial the lab fits.
